<h2 class="text-align-center">About This Work</h2>

<p class="no-indent">Goethe’s two-part dramatic work, <em>Faust</em>, based on a traditional theme, and finally completed in 1831, is an exploration of that restless intellectual and emotional urge which found its fullest expression in the European Romantic movement, to which Goethe was an early and major contributor. Part I of the work outlines a pact Faust makes with the devil, Mephistopheles, and encompasses the tragedy of Gretchen, whom Faust seduces. Part II, developed over a long period of Goethe’s later life, reflects Goethe’s own transition from a predominantly Romantic to a wider world-view and explores more extensive themes, including the values of the Classical past, as it moves towards the work’s resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The protagonist, Faust, is presented in a complex manner, and Goethe’s treatment of the subject matter raises ethical and spiritual issues, many of which are not resolved within the drama itself. Goethe’s stress is on Faust’s striving towards the good, and on the nature of human error, rather than on the traditional Christian view of sin and redemption, and the play’s opening sections and its conclusion can be seen as humanist allegory or metaphor rather than an expression of orthodox religious belief. It is left to the reader to draw their own conclusion about Faust’s everyman character, and the extent to which he earns his ultimate spiritual salvation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play had an enormous influence on later German thought and literature, and together with his lyric poetry has ensured Goethe’s place among the great European writers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again you show yourselves, you wavering Forms,</p>
<p>Revealed, as you once were, to clouded vision.</p>
<p>Shall I attempt to hold you fast once more?</p>
<p>Heart’s willing still to suffer that illusion?</p>
<p>You crowd so near! Well then, you shall endure, <span class="line-number">5</span></p>
<p>And rouse me, from your mist and cloud’s confusion:</p>
<p>My spirit feels so young again: it’s shaken</p>
<p>By magic breezes that your breathings waken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You bring with you the sight of joyful days,</p>
<p>And many a loved shade rises to the eye: <span class="line-number">10</span></p>
<p>And like some other half-forgotten phrase,</p>
<p>First Love returns, and Friendship too is nigh:</p>
<p>Pain is renewed, and sorrow: all the ways,</p>
<p>Life wanders in its labyrinthine flight,</p>
<p>Naming the good, those that Fate has robbed <span class="line-number">15</span></p>
<p>Of lovely hours, those slipped from me and lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can no longer hear this latest song,</p>
<p>Spirits, to whom I gave my early singing:</p>
<p>That kindly crowd itself is now long gone,</p>
<p>Alas, it dies away, that first loud ringing! <span class="line-number">20</span></p>
<p>I bring my verses to the unknown throng,</p>
<p>My heart’s made anxious even by their clapping,</p>
<p>And those besides delighted by my verse,</p>
<p>If they still live, are scattered through the Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel a long and unresolved desire <span class="line-number">25</span></p>
<p>For that serene and solemn land of ghosts,</p>
<p>It quivers now, like an Aeolian lyre,</p>
<p>My stuttering verse, with its uncertain notes,</p>
<p>A shudder takes me: tear on tear, entire,</p>
<p>The firm heart feels weakened and remote: <span class="line-number">30</span></p>
<p>What I possess seems far away from me,</p>
<p>And what is gone becomes reality.</p>

<h3 class="text-align-center" id="Prelude_On_Stage">Prelude On Stage</h3>
<p class="text-align-center">(<em>Director, Dramatist, Comedian</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Director</span> You two, who’ve often stood by me,</p>
<p>In times of need, when trouble’s breaking,</p>
<p>Say what success our undertaking <span class="line-number">35</span></p>
<p>Will meet with, then, in Germany?</p>
<p>I’d rather like the crowd to enjoy it,</p>
<p>Since they live and let live, truly.</p>
<p>The stage is set, the boards complete,</p>
<p>And they await our festivity. <span class="line-number">40</span></p>
<p>They’re seated already, eyebrows raised,</p>
<p>Calmly hoping they’ll be amazed.</p>
<p>I know how to make the people happy:</p>
<p>But I’ve never been so embarrassed: not</p>
<p>That they’ve been used to the best, you see, <span class="line-number">45</span></p>
<p>Yet they’ve all read such a dreadful lot.</p>
<p>How can we make it all seem fresh and new,</p>
<p>Weighty, but entertaining too?</p>
<p>I’d love to see a joyful crowd, that’s certain,</p>
<p>When the waves drive them to our place, <span class="line-number">50</span></p>
<p>And with tremendous and repeated surging,</p>
<p>Squeeze them through the narrow gate of grace:</p>
<p>In the light of day they’re there already,</p>
<p>Pushing, till they’ve reached the window,</p>
<p>As if they’re at the baker’s, starving, nearly <span class="line-number">55</span></p>
<p>Breaking their necks: just for a ticket. Oh!</p>
<p>Only poets can work this miracle on men</p>
<p>So various: the day is yours, my friend!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Dramatist</span> O, don’t speak to me of that varied crew,</p>
<p>The sight of whom makes inspiration fade. <span class="line-number">60</span></p>
<p>Veil, from me, the surging multitude,</p>
<p>Whose whirling will drives us everyway.</p>
<p>No, some heavenly silence lead me to,</p>
<p>Where for the poet alone pure joy’s at play:</p>
<p>Where Love and Friendship too grace our hearts, <span class="line-number">65</span></p>
<p>Created and inspired by heavenly arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah! What springs here from our deepest being,</p>
<p>What the shy trembling lips in speaking meant,</p>
<p>Now falling awry, and now perhaps succeeding,</p>
<p>Is swallowed in the fierce Moment’s violence. <span class="line-number">70</span></p>
<p>Often, when the first years are done, unseeing,</p>
<p>It appears at last, complete, in deepest sense.</p>
<p>What dazzles is a Momentary act:</p>
<p>What’s true is left for posterity, intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Comedian</span> Don’t speak about posterity to me! <span class="line-number">75</span></p>
<p>If I went on about posterity,</p>
<p>Where would you get your worldly fun?</p>
<p>Folk want it, and they’ll still have some.</p>
<p>The presence of a fine young man</p>
<p>Is nice, I think, for everyone. <span class="line-number">80</span></p>
<p>Who, comfortably, shares his wit,</p>
<p>And to their moods takes no exception:</p>
<p>He’ll make himself a greater hit,</p>
<p>And win a more secure reception.</p>
<p>Be brave, and show them what you’ve got, <span class="line-number">85</span></p>
<p>Have Fantasy with all her chorus, yes,</p>
<p>Mind, Reason, Passion, Tears, the lot,</p>
<p>But don’t you leave out Foolishness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Director</span> Make sure, above all, plenty’s happening there!</p>
<p>They come to look, and then they want to stare. <span class="line-number">90</span></p>
<p>Spin endlessly before their faces,</p>
<p>So the people gape amazed,</p>
<p>You’ve won them by your many paces,</p>
<p>You’ll be the man most praised.</p>
<p>The mass are only moved by things <em>en masse</em>, <span class="line-number">95</span></p>
<p>Each one, himself, will choose the bit he needs:</p>
<p>Who brings a lot, brings something that will pass:</p>
<p>And everyone goes home contentedly.</p>
<p>You’ll give a piece, why then give it them in pieces!</p>
<p>With such a stew you’re destined for success. <span class="line-number">100</span></p>
<p>Easy to serve, it’s as easy to invent.</p>
<p>What use to bring them your complete intent?</p>
<p>The Public will soon pick at what you’ve dressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Dramatist</span> You don’t see how badly such work will do!</p>
<p>How little it suits the genuine creator! <span class="line-number">105</span></p>
<p>Already, I see, it’s a principle with you.</p>
<p>The finest master is a sloppy worker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Director</span> Such a reproach leaves me unmoved:</p>
<p>The man who seeks to be approved,</p>
<p>Must stick to the best tools for it, <span class="line-number">110</span></p>
<p>Think, soft wood’s the best to split,</p>
<p>and have a look for whom you write!</p>
<p>See, this is one that boredom drives,</p>
<p>Another’s from some overloaded table,</p>
<p>Or, worst of all, he’s one arrives, <span class="line-number">115</span></p>
<p>Like most, fresh from the daily paper.</p>
<p>They rush here mindlessly, as to a Masque,</p>
<p>And curiosity inspires their hurry:</p>
<p>The ladies bring themselves, and in their best,</p>
<p>Come and play their parts and ask no fee. <span class="line-number">120</span></p>
<p>What dream of yours is this, exalted verse?</p>
<p>Doesn’t a full house make you happy?</p>
<p>Have a good look at your patrons first!</p>
<p>One half are coarse, the rest are chilly.</p>
<p>After the show <em>he</em> hopes for card-play: <span class="line-number">125</span></p>
<p><em>He</em> hopes for a wild night, and a woman’s kiss.</p>
<p>Why then do so many poor fools plague,</p>
<p>The sweet Muse, for such a goal as this?</p>
<p>I tell you, just give them more and more,</p>
<p>So you’ll never stray far from the mark, <span class="line-number">130</span></p>
<p>Just seek to confuse them, in the dark:</p>
<p>To keep them happy, that’s hard - for sure.</p>
<p>And now what’s wrong? Delight or Pain?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Dramatist</span> Go, look for another scribbler by night!</p>
<p>Shall the poet throw away the highest right, <span class="line-number">135</span></p>
<p>The right of humanity, that Nature gave,</p>
<p>Carelessly, so that <em>you</em> might gain!</p>
<p>How will he move all hearts again?</p>
<p>How will each element be his slave?</p>
<p>Is that harmony nothing, from his breast unfurled, <span class="line-number">140</span></p>
<p>That draws back into his own heart, the world?</p>
<p>When Nature winds the lengthened filaments,</p>
<p>Indifferently, on her eternal spindle,</p>
<p>When all the tuneless mass of elements,</p>
<p>In their sullen discord, jar and jangle – <span class="line-number">145</span></p>
<p>Who parts the ever-flowing ranks of creation,</p>
<p>Stirs them, so rhythmic measure is assured?</p>
<p>Who calls the One to general ordination,</p>
<p>Where it may ring in marvellous accord?</p>
<p>Who lets the storm wind rage with passion, <span class="line-number">150</span></p>
<p>The sunset glow the senses move?</p>
<p>Who scatters every lovely springtime blossom</p>
<p>Beneath the footsteps of the one we love?</p>
<p>Who weaves the slight green wreath of leaves,</p>
<p>To honour work well done in every art? <span class="line-number">155</span></p>
<p>What makes Olympus sure, joins deities?</p>
<p>The power of Man, revealed by the bard.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Comedian</span> So use it then, all this fine energy,</p>
<p>And drive along the work of poetry,</p>
<p>To show how <em>we</em> are driven in Love’s play. <span class="line-number">160</span></p>
<p>By chance we meet, we feel, we stay,</p>
<p>And bit by bit we’re tightly bound:</p>
<p>Happiness grows, and then it’s fenced around:</p>
<p>We’re all inflamed then comes the sorrowing:</p>
<p>Before you know it, there’s a novel brewing! <span class="line-number">165</span></p>
<p>Why don’t <em>we</em> give such a piece!</p>
<p>Grasp the life of man complete!</p>
<p>Everyone lives, though it’s seldom confessed,</p>
<p>And wherever you grasp, there’s interest.</p>
<p>In varied pictures there’s little light, <span class="line-number">170</span></p>
<p>A lot of error, and a gleam of right,</p>
<p>So the best of drinks is brewed,</p>
<p>So the world’s cheered and renewed.</p>
<p>Then see the flower of lovely youth collect,</p>
<p>To hear your words, and view the offering, <span class="line-number">175</span></p>
<p>And every tender nature will extract</p>
<p>A melancholy food from what you bring,</p>
<p>They’ll gain now this and that from your art,</p>
<p>So each sees what is present in their heart.</p>
<p>They’re readily moved to weeping or to laughter, <span class="line-number">180</span></p>
<p>They’ll admire your verve, and enjoy the show:</p>
<p>What’s finished you can never alter after:</p>
<p>Minds still in growth will be grateful though.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Dramatist</span> So give me back that time again,</p>
<p>When I was still ‘becoming’, <span class="line-number">185</span></p>
<p>When words gushed like a fountain</p>
<p>In new, and endless flowing,</p>
<p>Then for me mists veiled the world,</p>
<p>In every bud the wonder glowed,</p>
<p>A thousand flowers I unfurled, <span class="line-number">190</span></p>
<p>That every valley, richly, showed.</p>
<p>I had nothing, yet enough:</p>
<p>Joy in illusion, thirst for truth.</p>
<p>Give every passion, free to move,</p>
<p>The deepest bliss, filled with pain, <span class="line-number">195</span></p>
<p>The force of hate, the power of love,</p>
<p>Oh, give me back my youth again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Comedian</span> Youth is what you need, dear friend,</p>
<p>When enemies jostle you, of course,</p>
<p>And girls, filled with desire, bend <span class="line-number">200</span></p>
<p>Their arms around your neck, with force,</p>
<p>When the swift-run race’s garland</p>
<p>Beckons from the hard-won goal,</p>
<p>When from the swirling dance, a man</p>
<p>Drinks until the night is old. <span class="line-number">205</span></p>
<p>But to play that well-known lyre</p>
<p>With courage and with grace,</p>
<p>Moved by self-imposed desire,</p>
<p>At a sweet wandering pace,</p>
<p>That is your function, Age, <span class="line-number">210</span></p>
<p>And our respect won’t lessen.</p>
<p>Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say,</p>
<p>It finds that we’re still children.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Director</span> That’s enough words for the moment,</p>
<p>Now let me see some action! <span class="line-number">215</span></p>
<p>While you’re handing out the compliments,</p>
<p>You should also make things happen.</p>
<p>Why talk so much of inspiration?</p>
<p>Delay won’t make it flow, you see.</p>
<p>Since Poetry gave the gift of creation, <span class="line-number">220</span></p>
<p>Take your orders then from Poetry.</p>
<p>You know what’s wanted here,</p>
<p>We need strong ale to appear:</p>
<p>So brew me a barrel right away!</p>
<p>Tomorrow won’t do what’s undone today, <span class="line-number">225</span></p>
<p>We shouldn’t waste a minute, so</p>
<p>Decide what’s possible, and just</p>
<p>Grasp it firmly like a hoe,</p>
<p>Make sure that you let nothing go,</p>
<p>And work it about, because you must. <span class="line-number">230</span></p>
<p>On the German stage, you see,</p>
<p>Everyone tries out what he can:</p>
<p>Don’t fail to show me, I’m your man,</p>
<p>Your trap-doors, and your scenery.</p>
<p>Use heavenly lights, the big and small, <span class="line-number">235</span></p>
<p>Squander stars in any number,</p>
<p>Rocky cliffs, and fire, and water,</p>
<p>Birds and creatures, use them all.</p>
<p>So in our narrow playhouse waken</p>
<p>The whole wide circle of creation, <span class="line-number">240</span></p>
<p>And stride, deliberately, as well,</p>
<p>From Heaven, through the world, to Hell.</p>

<p>I’ve finished Law and Medicine, <span class="line-number">355</span></p>
<p>And sadly even Theology:</p>

<p>Now here I am, a fool for sure!</p>
<p>No wiser than I was before:</p>
<p>Master, Doctor’s what they call me, <span class="line-number">360</span></p>
<p>And I’ve been ten years, already,</p>
<p>Crosswise, arcing, to and fro,</p>
<p>Leading my students by the nose,</p>
<p>And see that we can know - nothing!</p>
<p>It almost sets my heart burning. <span class="line-number">365</span></p>
<p>I’m cleverer than all these teachers,</p>
<p>Doctors, Masters, scribes, preachers:</p>
<p>I’m not plagued by doubt or scruple,</p>
<p>Scared by neither Hell nor Devil –</p>
<p>Instead all Joy is snatched away, <span class="line-number">370</span></p>
<p>What’s worth knowing, I can’t say,</p>
<p>I can’t say what I should teach</p>
<p>To make men better or convert each.</p>
<p>And then I’ve neither goods nor gold,</p>
<p>No worldly honour, or splendour hold: <span class="line-number">375</span></p>
<p>Not even a dog would play this part!</p>
<p>So I’ve given myself to Magic art,</p>

<p>I might have all secrets at my fingertips.</p>
<p>And no longer, with rancid sweat, so, <span class="line-number">380</span></p>
<p>Still have to speak what I cannot know:</p>
<p>That I may understand whatever</p>
<p>Binds the world’s innermost core together,</p>
<p>See all its workings, and its seeds,</p>
<p>Deal no more in words’ empty reeds. <span class="line-number">385</span></p>

<p>Ah! If on the mountain height</p>
<p>I might stand in your sweet light,</p>
<p>Float with spirits in mountain caves,</p>
<p>Swim the meadows in twilight’ waves, <span class="line-number">395</span></p>
<p>Free from the smoke of knowledge too,</p>
<p>Bathe in your health-giving dew!</p>

<p>Glass vials, boxes round me, hurled,</p>

<p>This is my world! And what a world!</p>
<p>And need you ask why my heart <span class="line-number">410</span></p>
<p>Makes such tremors in my breast?</p>

<p>Blessings from their wings disperse:</p>
<p>They penetrate from Heaven to Earth,</p>
<p>Sounding a harmony through the Universe!</p>
<p>Such a picture! Ah, alas! Merely a picture!</p>
<p>How then can I grasp you endless Nature? <span class="line-number">455</span></p>
<p>Where are your breasts that pour out Life entire,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> Oh, God! Art is long</p>
<p>And life is short.</p>
<p>Often the studies that I’m working on <span class="line-number">560</span></p>

<p>How hard it is to command the means</p>
<p>By which a man attains the very source!</p>
<p>Before a man has travelled half his course,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Parchment then, is that your holy well,</p>
<p>From which drink always slakes your thirst?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> Pardon me, but it’s a great delight <span class="line-number">570</span></p>
<p>When, moved by the spirit of the ages, we have sight</p>
<p>Of how a wiser man has thought, and how</p>
<p>Widely at last we’ve spread his word about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Oh yes, as widely as the constellations!</p>
<p>My friend, all of the ages that are gone <span class="line-number">575</span></p>
<p>Now make up a book with seven seals.</p>
<p>The spirit of the ages, that you find,</p>
<p>In the end, is the spirit of Humankind:</p>
<p>A mirror where all the ages are revealed.</p>
<p>And so often it’s all a mere misery <span class="line-number">580</span></p>
<p>Something we run away from at first sight.</p>
<p>A pile of sweepings, a lumber room, maybe</p>
<p>At best, a puppet show, that’s bright</p>
<p>With maxims, excellent, pragmatic,</p>
<p>Suitable when dolls’ mouths wax dramatic! <span class="line-number">585</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> But, the world! Men’s hearts and minds!</p>
<p>Something of those, at least, I’d like to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Yes, what men choose to understand!</p>
<p>Who dares to name the child’s real name, though?</p>
<p>The few who knew what might be learned, <span class="line-number">590</span></p>
<p>Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show,</p>
<p>And reveal their feelings to the crowd below,</p>
<p>Mankind has always crucified and burned.</p>
<p>I beg you, friend, it’s now the dead of night,</p>
<p>We must break up this conversation. <span class="line-number">595</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> I would have watched with you, if I might</p>
<p>Speak with you still, so learned in oration.</p>
<p>But tomorrow, on Easter’s first holy day,</p>
<p>I’ll ask my several questions, if I may.</p>
<p>I’ve pursued my work, zealously studying: <span class="line-number">600</span></p>
<p>There’s much I know: yet I’d know everything.</p>
<p>(<em>He leaves</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> (<em>Alone</em>.)</p>
<p>That mind alone never loses hope,</p>
<p>That keeps to the shallows eternally,</p>
<p>Grabs, with eager hand, the wealth it sees,</p>
<p>And rejoices at the worms for which it gropes! <span class="line-number">605</span></p>
<p>Dare such a human voice echo, too,</p>
<p>Where this depth of Spirit surrounds me?</p>
<p>Ah yet! For just this once, my thanks to you,</p>
<p>You sorriest of all earth’s progeny!</p>
<p>You’ve torn me away from that despair, <span class="line-number">610</span></p>
<p>That would have soon overwhelmed my senses.</p>
<p>Ah! The apparition was so hugely there,</p>
<p>It might have truly dwarfed my defences.</p>
<p>I, image of the Godhead, already one,</p>
<p>Who thought the spirit of eternal truth so near, <span class="line-number">615</span></p>
<p>Enjoying the light, both heavenly and clear,</p>
<p>Setting to one side the earthbound man:</p>
<p>I, more than Angel, a free force,</p>
<p>Ready to flow through Nature’s veins,</p>
<p>And, in creating, enjoy the life divine, <span class="line-number">620</span></p>
<p>Pulsing with ideas: must atone again!</p>
<p>A word like thunder swept me away.</p>
<p>I dare not measure myself against you.</p>
<p>I possessed the power to summon you,</p>
<p>But not the power to make you stay. <span class="line-number">625</span></p>
<p>In that blissful moment, then</p>
<p>I felt myself so small, so great:</p>
<p>Cruelly you hurled me back again,</p>
<p>Into Man’s uncertain state.</p>
<p>What shall I learn from? Or leave? <span class="line-number">630</span></p>
<p>Shall I obey that yearning?</p>
<p>Ah! Our actions, and not just our grief,</p>
<p>Impede us on life’s journey.</p>
<p>Some more and more alien substance presses</p>
<p>On the splendour that the Mind conceives: <span class="line-number">635</span></p>
<p>And when we gain what this world possesses,</p>
<p>We say the better world’s dream deceives.</p>
<p>The splendid feelings that give us life,</p>
<p>Fade among the crowd’s earthly strife.</p>
<p>If imagination flew with courage, once, <span class="line-number">640</span></p>
<p>And, full of hope, stretched out to eternity,</p>
<p>Now a little room is quite enough,</p>
<p>When joy on joy has gone, in time’s whirling sea.</p>
<p>Care has nested in the heart’s depths,</p>
<p>Restless, she rocks there, spoiling joy and rest, <span class="line-number">645</span></p>
<p>There she works her secret pain,</p>
<p>And wears new masks, ever and again,</p>
<p>Appears as wife and child, fields and houses,</p>
<p>As water, fire, or knife or poison:</p>
<p>Still we tremble for what never strikes us, <span class="line-number">650</span></p>
<p>And must still cry for what has not yet gone.</p>
<p>I am no god: I feel it all too deeply.</p>
<p>I am the worm that writhes in dust: see,</p>
<p>As in the dust it lives, and seeks to eat,</p>
<p>It’s crushed and buried by the passing feet. <span class="line-number">655</span></p>
<p>Is this not dust, what these vaults hold,</p>
<p>These hundred shelves that cramp me:</p>
<p>This junk, and all the thousand-fold</p>
<p>Shapes, of a moth-ridden world, around me?</p>
<p>Will I find here what I’m lacking else, <span class="line-number">660</span></p>
<p>Shall I read, perhaps, as a thousand books insist,</p>
<p>That Mankind everywhere torments itself,</p>
<p>So, here and there, some happy man exists?</p>
<p>What do you say to me, bare grinning skull?</p>
<p>Except that once your brain whirled like mine, <span class="line-number">665</span></p>
<p>Sought the clear day, and in the twilight dull,</p>
<p>With a breath of truth, went wretchedly awry.</p>
<p>For sure, you instruments mock at me,</p>
<p>With cylinders and arms, wheels and cogs:</p>
<p>I stand at the door: and you should be the key: <span class="line-number">670</span></p>
<p>You’re deftly cut, but you undo no locks.</p>
<p>Mysterious, even in broad daylight,</p>
<p>Nature won’t let her veil be raised:</p>
<p>What your spirit can’t bring to sight,</p>
<p>Won’t by screws and levers be displayed. <span class="line-number">675</span></p>
<p>You, ancient tools, I’ve never used</p>
<p>You’re here because my father used you,</p>
<p>Ancient scroll, you’ve darkened too,</p>
<p>From smoking candles burned above you.</p>
<p>Better the little I had was squandered, <span class="line-number">680</span></p>
<p>Than sweat here under its puny weight!</p>
<p>What from your father you’ve inherited,</p>
<p>You must earn again, to own it straight.</p>
<p>What’s never used, leaves us overburdened,</p>
<p>But we <em>can</em> use what the Moment may create! <span class="line-number">685</span></p>
<p>Yet why does that place so draw my sight,</p>
<p>Is that flask a magnet for my gaze?</p>
<p>Why is there suddenly so sweet a light,</p>
<p>As moonlight in a midnight woodland plays?</p>
<p>I salute you, phial of rare potion, <span class="line-number">690</span></p>
<p>I lift you down, with devotion!</p>
<p>In you I worship man’s art and mind,</p>
<p>Embodiment of sweet sleeping draughts:</p>
<p>Extract, with deadly power, refined,</p>
<p>Show your master all his craft! <span class="line-number">695</span></p>
<p>I see you, and my pain diminishes,</p>
<p>I grasp you, and my struggles grow less,</p>
<p>My spirit’s flood tide ebbs, more and more,</p>
<p>I seem to be where ocean waters meet,</p>
<p>A glassy flood gleams around my feet, <span class="line-number">700</span></p>
<p>New day invites me to a newer shore.</p>
<p>A fiery chariot sweeps nearer</p>
<p>On light wings! I feel ready, free</p>
<p>To cut a new path through the ether</p>
<p>And reach new spheres of pure activity. <span class="line-number">705</span></p>
<p>This greater life, this godlike bliss!</p>
<p>You, but a worm, have you earned this?</p>
<p>Choosing to turn your back, ah yes,</p>
<p>On all Earth’s lovely Sun might promise!</p>
<p>Let me dare to throw those gates open, <span class="line-number">710</span></p>
<p>That other men go creeping by!</p>
<p>Now’s the time, to prove through action</p>
<p>Man’s dignity may rise divinely high,</p>
<p>Never trembling at that void where,</p>
<p>Imagination damns itself to pain, <span class="line-number">715</span></p>
<p>Striving towards the passage there,</p>
<p>Round whose mouth all Hell’s fires flame:</p>
<p>Choose to take that step, happy to go</p>
<p>Where danger lies, where Nothingness may flow.</p>
<p>Come here to me, cup of crystal, clear! <span class="line-number">720</span></p>
<p>Free of your ancient cover now appear,</p>
<p>You whom I’ve never, for many a year,</p>
<p>Considered! You shone at ancestral feasts,</p>
<p>Cheering the over-serious guests:</p>
<p>One man passing you to another here. <span class="line-number">725</span></p>
<p>It was the drinker’s duty to explain in rhyme</p>
<p>The splendour of your many carved designs</p>
<p>Or drain it at a draught, and breathe, in time:</p>
<p>You remind me of those youthful nights of mine.</p>
<p>Now I will never pass you to a friend, <span class="line-number">730</span></p>
<p>Or test my wits on your art again.</p>
<p>Here’s a juice will stun any man born:</p>
<p>It fills your hollow with a browner liquid.</p>
<p>I prepared it, now I choose the fluid,</p>
<p>At last I drink, and with my soul I bid <span class="line-number">735</span></p>

<p>Look down, where the town’s in sight.</p>
<p>That cavernous, dark gate,</p>
<p>The colourful crowd penetrate,</p>
<p>All will take the sun today, <span class="line-number">920</span></p>
<p>The Risen Lord they’ll celebrate,</p>
<p>And feel they are resurrected,</p>
<p>From low houses, dully made,</p>
<p>From work, where they’re constricted,</p>
<p>From the roofs’ and gables’ weight, <span class="line-number">925</span></p>
<p>From the crush of narrow streets,</p>
<p>From the churches’ solemn night</p>
<p>They’re all brought to the light.</p>
<p>Look now: see! The crowds, their feet</p>
<p>Crushing the gardens and meadows, <span class="line-number">930</span></p>
<p>While on the river a cheerful fleet</p>
<p>Of little boats everywhere it flows.</p>
<p>And over-laden, ready to sink,</p>
<p>The last barge takes to the stream.</p>
<p>From far off on the mountain’s brink, <span class="line-number">935</span></p>
<p>All the bright clothing gleams.</p>
<p>I hear the noise from the village risen,</p>
<p>Here is the people’s true Heaven,</p>
<p>High and low shout happily:</p>
<p>Here I am Man: here, dare to be! <span class="line-number">940</span></p> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> Doctor, to take a walk with you,</p>
<p>Is an honour and a prize:</p>
<p>Alone I’d have no business here, true,</p>

<p>Shrieking, fiddlers, skittles flying, <span class="line-number">945</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shepherd for the dance, had on</p>
<p>His gaudy jacket, wreath, and ribbon, <span class="line-number">950</span></p>
<p>Making a fine show,</p>
<p>Under the linden-tree, already,</p>
<p>Everyone was dancing madly.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Hurrah! Hurray! <span class="line-number">955</span></p>
<p>So goes the fiddle-bow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his haste, in a whirl,</p>
<p>He stumbled against a girl,</p>
<p>With his elbow flailing:</p>
<p>Lively, she turned, and said: <span class="line-number">960</span></p>
<p>Mind out, you wooden-head!</p>
<p>Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Hurrah! Hurray!</p>
<p>Just watch where you’re sailing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast around the circle bright, <span class="line-number">965</span></p>
<p>They danced to left and right,</p>
<p>Skirts and jackets flying.</p>
<p>They grew red: they grew warm,</p>
<p>They rested, panting, arm on arm</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! <span class="line-number">970</span></p>
<p>Hurrah! Hurray!</p>
<p>And hip, and elbow, lying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be so familiar then!</p>
<p>That’s how many a lying man,</p>
<p>Cheated his wife so! <span class="line-number">975</span></p>
<p>But he soon tempted her aside,</p>
<p>And from the linden echoed wide:</p>
<p>Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Hurrah! Hurray!</p>

<p>Each one asks and pushes near,</p>
<p>The fiddle halts, and the dancers there:</p>
<p>You pass: in ranks they stop to see,</p>
<p>And throw their caps high in the air:</p>
<p>A little more and they’d bend the knee, <span class="line-number">1020</span></p>
<p>As if what they worshipped was holy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Climb these few steps to that stone,</p>
<p>Here we’ll rest from our wandering.</p>
<p>Here I’ve sat often, thoughtful and alone,</p>
<p>Tormenting myself with prayer and fasting. <span class="line-number">1025</span></p>
<p>Rich in hope, and firm of faith,</p>
<p>Wringing my hands, with sighs even,</p>
<p>Tears, to force the end of plague</p>
<p>From the very God of Heaven.</p>
<p>The crowd’s approval now’s like scorn. <span class="line-number">1030</span></p>
<p>O if you could read within me</p>
<p>How little the father and the son</p>
<p>Deserve a fraction of their glory.</p>
<p>My father was a gloomy, honourable man,</p>
<p>Who pondered Nature and the heavenly spheres, <span class="line-number">1035</span></p>
<p>Honestly, in his own fashion,</p>
<p>With eccentric studies it appears:</p>
<p>He, in his adepts’ company,</p>
<p>Locked in his dark workshop, forever</p>
<p>Tried with endless recipes, <span class="line-number">1040</span></p>
<p>To make things opposite flow together.</p>
<p>The fiery Lion, a daring suitor,</p>
<p>Wed the Lily, in a lukewarm bath, there</p>
<p>In a fiery flame, both of them were</p>
<p>Strained from one bride-bed into another, <span class="line-number">1045</span></p>
<p>Until the young Queen was descried,</p>
<p>In a mix of colours, in the glass:</p>
<p>There was the medicine: the patient died.</p>
<p>And who recovered? No one asked.</p>
<p>So we roamed, with our hellish pills, <span class="line-number">1050</span></p>
<p>Among the valleys and the hills,</p>
<p>Worse than the pestilence itself we were.</p>
<p>I’ve poisoned a thousand: that’s quite clear:</p>
<p>And now from the withered old must hear</p>
<p>How men praise a shameless murderer. <span class="line-number">1055</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> How can you grieve at that!</p>
<p>Isn’t it enough for an honest man</p>
<p>To exercise the skill he has,</p>
<p>Carefully, precisely, as given?</p>
<p>Honour your father as a youth, <span class="line-number">1060</span></p>
<p>And receive his teaching in your soul,</p>
<p>As a man, then, add to scientific truth,</p>
<p>So your son can achieve a higher goal.</p>

<p>But don’t let such despondency</p>
<p>Spoil the deep goodness of the hour!</p>
<p>In the evening glow, we see <span class="line-number">1070</span></p>
<p>The houses gleaming, green-embowered.</p>
<p>Mild it retreats, the day that’s left,</p>
<p>It slips away to claim new being.</p>
<p>Ah, that no wing from earth can lift</p>
<p>Me, closer and closer to it, striving! <span class="line-number">1075</span></p>
<p>I’d see, in eternal evening’s light,</p>
<p>The silent Earth beneath my feet, forever,</p>
<p>The heights on fire, each valley quiet</p>
<p>While silver streams flow to a golden river.</p>
<p>The wild peaks with their deep clefts, <span class="line-number">1080</span></p>
<p>Would cease to bar my godlike way,</p>
<p>Already the sea with its warm depths,</p>
<p>Opens to my astonished gaze.</p>
<p>At last the weary god sinks down to night:</p>
<p>But in me a newer yearning wakes, <span class="line-number">1085</span></p>
<p>I hasten on, drinking his endless light:</p>
<p>The dark behind me: and ahead the day.</p>
<p>Heaven above me: and the waves below,</p>
<p>A lovely dream, although it vanishes.</p>
<p>Ah! Wings of the mind, so weightless <span class="line-number">1090</span></p>
<p>No bodily wings could ever be so.</p>
<p>Yet it’s natural in every spirit, too,</p>
<p>That feeling drives us, up and on,</p>
<p>When over us, lost in the vault of blue,</p>
<p>The lark sings his piercing song, <span class="line-number">1095</span></p>
<p>When over the steep pine-filled peaks,</p>
<p>The eagle widely soars,</p>
<p>And across the plains and seas,</p>
<p>The cranes seek their home shores.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> I’ve often had strange moments, I know, <span class="line-number">1100</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t ask the birds for wings: indeed,</p>
<p>How differently the mind’s raptures lead</p>
<p>Us on, from book to book, and page to page! <span class="line-number">1105</span></p>
<p>Then winter nights are beautiful, and sweet,</p>
<p>A blissful warmth steals through your limbs, too</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You only feel the one yearning at best, <span class="line-number">1110</span></p>
<p>Oh, never seek to know the other!</p>
<p>Two souls, alas, exist in my breast,</p>
<p>One separated from another:</p>
<p>One, with its crude love of life, just</p>
<p>Clings to the world, tenaciously, grips tight, <span class="line-number">1115</span></p>
<p>The other soars powerfully above the dust,</p>
<p>Into the far ancestral height.</p>
<p>Oh, let the spirits of the air,</p>
<p>Between the heavens and Earth, weaving,</p>
<p>Descend through the golden atmosphere, <span class="line-number">1120</span></p>
<p>And lead me on to new and varied being!</p>
<p>Yes, if a magic cloak were mine, that</p>
<p>Would carry me off to foreign lands,</p>
<p>Not for the costliest garment in my hands,</p>
<p>For the mantle of a king, would I resign it! <span class="line-number">1125</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> We usually gather from your names</p>
<p>The nature of you gentlemen: it’s plain</p>
<p>What you are, we all too clearly recognise</p>
<p>One who’s called Liar, Ruin, Lord of the Flies.</p>
<p>Well, what are you then? <span class="line-number">1335</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Part of the Power that would</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> What meaning to these riddling words applies?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I am the spirit, ever, that denies!</p>
<p>And rightly so: since everything created,</p>
<p>In turn deserves to be annihilated: <span class="line-number">1340</span></p>
<p>Better if nothing came to be.</p>
<p>So all that you call Sin, you see,</p>
<p>Destruction, in short, what you’ve meant</p>
<p>By Evil is my true element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You call yourself a part, yet seem complete to me? <span class="line-number">1345</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I’m speaking the truth to you, and modestly.</p>
<p>Even if Man’s accustomed to take</p>
<p>His small world for the Whole, that’s his mistake:</p>
<p>I’m part of the part, that once was - everything,</p>
<p>Part of the darkness, from which Light, issuing, <span class="line-number">1350</span></p>
<p>Proud Light, emergent, disputed the highest place</p>
<p>With its mother Night, the bounds of Space,</p>
<p>And yet won nothing, however hard it tried,</p>
<p>Still stuck to Bodily Things, and so denied.</p>
<p>It flows from bodies, which it beautifies, <span class="line-number">1355</span></p>
<p>And bodies block its way:</p>
<p>I hope the day’s not far away</p>
<p>When it, along with all these bodies, dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Now I see the plan you follow!</p>
<p>You can’t destroy it all, and so <span class="line-number">1360</span></p>
<p>You’re working on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> And frankly it’s a sorry tale.</p>
<p>What’s set against the Nothingness,</p>
<p>The Something, World’s clumsiness,</p>
<p>Despite everything I’ve tried, <span class="line-number">1365</span></p>
<p>Won’t become a nothing: though I’d</p>
<p>Storms, quakes, and fires on every hand,</p>
<p>It deigned to stay as sea and land!</p>
<p>And those Men and creatures, all the damned,</p>
<p>It’s no use my owning any of that crew: <span class="line-number">1370</span></p>
<p>How many I’ve already done with too!</p>
<p>Yet new fresh blood is always going round.</p>
<p>So it goes on, men make me furious!</p>
<p>With water, earth and air, of course,</p>
<p>A thousand buds unfurl <span class="line-number">1375</span></p>
<p>In wet and dry, warm and cold!</p>
<p>And if I hadn’t kept back fire of old,</p>
<p><em>I’d</em> have nothing left at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> So you set the Devil’s fist</p>
<p>That vainly clenches itself, <span class="line-number">1380</span></p>
<p>Against the eternally active,</p>

<p>Strange son of Chaos, start</p>
<p>On something else instead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Truly I’ll think about it: more <span class="line-number">1385</span></p>

<p>Might I be allowed to go?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I see no reason for you to ask it.</p>

<p>There’s the door, here’s the window,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I must confess, I’m prevented though</p>

<p>Then tell me, you Son of Hell,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Look carefully! It’s not completed: <span class="line-number">1400</span></p>
<p>One angle, if you inspect it closely</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Just by chance as it happens!</p>
<p>And left you prisoner to me?</p>
<p>Success created by approximation! <span class="line-number">1405</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> The dog saw nothing, in his animation,</p>
<p>Now the affair seems inside out,</p>
<p>The Devil can’t get <em>out</em> of the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Why not try the window then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> To devils and ghosts the same laws appertain: <span class="line-number">1410</span></p>
<p>The same way they enter in, they must go out.</p>
<p>In the first we’re free, in the second slaves to the act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> So you still have laws in Hell, in fact?</p>
<p>That’s good, since it allows a pact,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> What’s promised you’ll enjoy, and find,</p>

<p>But it can’t be done so fast,</p>
<p>First we’ll have to talk it through,</p>
<p>Yet, urgently, I beg of you <span class="line-number">1420</span></p>
<p>Let me go my way at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Wait a moment now,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I’m willing, if you so wish, <span class="line-number">1430</span></p>

<p>Starlight sparkling</p>
<p>Milder sun <span class="line-number">1455</span></p>
<p>Shining clear.</p>
<p>Heavenly children</p>
<p>In lovely confusion,</p>
<p>Swaying and bending,</p>
<p>Drifting past. <span class="line-number">1460</span></p>
<p>Affectionate yearning,</p>
<p>Following fast:</p>
<p>Their garments flowing</p>
<p>With fluttering ribbons,</p>
<p>Cover the gardens, <span class="line-number">1465</span></p>
<p>Cover the leaves,</p>
<p>Where with each other</p>
<p>In deep conversation</p>
<p>Lover meets lover.</p>
<p>Leaves on leaves! <span class="line-number">1470</span></p>
<p>Tendrils’ elation!</p>
<p>Grapes beneath</p>
<p>Crushed in a stream,</p>
<p>Pressed to extreme,</p>
<p>Crushed to fountain, <span class="line-number">1475</span></p>
<p>Of foaming wine,</p>
<p>Trickling, fine,</p>
<p>Through rocks divine,</p>
<p>Leaving the heights,</p>
<p>Spreading beneath, <span class="line-number">1480</span></p>
<p>Broad as the seas,</p>
<p>Valleys it fills</p>
<p>Round the green hills.</p>
<p>And the wings still,</p>
<p>Blissfully drunk, <span class="line-number">1485</span></p>
<p>Fly to the sun,</p>
<p>Fly to the brightness,</p>
<p>Towards the islands,</p>
<p>Out of the waves</p>
<p>Magically raised: <span class="line-number">1490</span></p>
<p>Now we can hear</p>
<p>The choir of joy near,</p>
<p>Over the meadow,</p>
<p>See how they dance now,</p>
<p>All in the air <span class="line-number">1495</span></p>
<p>Dispersing there.</p>
<p>Some of them climbing</p>
<p>Over the mountains,</p>
<p>Others are swimming</p>
<p>Over the ocean, <span class="line-number">1500</span></p>
<p>Others take flight:</p>
<p>All towards Life,</p>
<p>All towards distant,</p>
<p>Love of the stars, and</p>
<p>Approval’s bliss. <span class="line-number">1505</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> He’s asleep! Enough, you delicate children of air!</p>

<p>Spellbind him with dream-forms, cast <span class="line-number">1510</span></p>
<p>Him deep into illusions’ sea:</p>
<p>Now, for the magic sill I must pass,</p>
<p>I could use rat’s teeth: no need for me</p>
<p>To conjure up a lengthier spell,</p>
<p>One’s rustling here that will do well. <span class="line-number">1515</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord of Rats and Mice,</p>
<p>Of Flies, Frogs, Bugs and Lice,</p>
<p>Summons you to venture here,</p>
<p>And gnaw the threshold where</p>
<p>He stains it with a little oil - <span class="line-number">1520</span></p>
<p>You’ve hopped, already, to your toil!</p>
<p>Now set to work! The fatal point,</p>
<p>Is at the edge, it’s on the front.</p>
<p>One more bite, then it’s complete –</p>
<p>Now Faust, dream deeply, till we meet. <span class="line-number">1525</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> (<em>Waking</em>.)</p>
<p>Am I cheated then, once again?</p>
<p>Does the Spirit-Realm’s deep yearning fade:</p>
<p>So a mere dream has conjured up the devil,</p>
<p>And only a dog, it was, that ran away?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Ah, now, you please me.</p>
<p>I hope we’ll get along together:</p>
<p>To drive away the gloomy weather,</p>
<p>I’m dressed like young nobility, <span class="line-number">1535</span></p>
<p>In a scarlet gold-trimmed coat,</p>
<p>In a little silk-lined cloak,</p>
<p>A cockerel feather in my hat,</p>
<p>With a long, pointed sword,</p>
<p>And I advise you, at that, <span class="line-number">1540</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> This life of earth, its narrowness,</p>

<p>Too young, still, to be passionless.</p>
<p>What can the world bring me again?</p>
<p>Abstain! You shall! You must! Abstain!</p>
<p>That’s the eternal song <span class="line-number">1550</span></p>

<p>Ebb, in wilful depreciation:</p>
<p>A thousand grimaces life employs <span class="line-number">1560</span></p>

<p>Then when night descends I must</p>
<p>Stretch out, worried, on my bed:</p>

<p>But some wild dream instead. <span class="line-number">1565</span></p>
<p>The God that lives inside my heart,</p>
<p>Can rouse my innermost seeing:</p>
<p>The one enthroned beyond my art,</p>
<p>Can’t stir external being:</p>
<p>And so existence is a burden: sated, <span class="line-number">1570</span></p>
<p>Death’s desired, and Life is hated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Yet Death’s a guest who’s visit’s never wholly celebrated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> No, no! The Devil is an egotist,</p>
<p>Does nothing lightly, or in God’s name,</p>
<p>To help another, so I insist,</p>
<p>Speak your demands out loud,</p>
<p>Such servants are risks, in a house. <span class="line-number">1655</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I’ll be your servant here, and I’ll</p>
<p>Not stop or rest, at your decree:</p>
<p>When we’re together, on the other side,</p>
<p>You’ll do the same for me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> The ‘other side’ concerns me less: <span class="line-number">1660</span></p>
<p>Shatter this world, in pieces,</p>
<p>The other one can take its place,</p>
<p>The root of my joy’s on this Earth,</p>
<p>And this Sun lights my sorrow:</p>
<p>If I must part from them tomorrow, <span class="line-number">1665</span></p>
<p>What can or will be, that I’ll face.</p>
<p>I’ll hear no more of it, of whether</p>
<p>In that future, men both hate and love,</p>
<p>Or whether in those spheres, forever,</p>
<p>We’re given a below and an above. <span class="line-number">1670</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> In that case, you can venture all.</p>
<p>Commit yourself: today, you shall</p>
<p>View my arts with joy: I mean</p>
<p>To show you what no man has seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Poor devil what <em>can</em> you give? When has ever <span class="line-number">1675</span></p>
<p>A human spirit, in its highest endeavour,</p>
<p>Been understood by such a one as you?</p>
<p>You have a never-satiating food,</p>
<p>You have your restless gold, a slew</p>
<p>Of quicksilver, melting in the hand, <span class="line-number">1680</span></p>
<p>Games whose prize no man can land,</p>
<p>A girl, who while she’s on my arm,</p>
<p>Snares a neighbour, with her eyes:</p>
<p>And Honour’s fine and godlike charm,</p>
<p>That, like a meteor, dies? <span class="line-number">1685</span></p>
<p>Show me fruits then that rot, before they’re ready.</p>
<p>And trees grown green again, each day, too!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Such commands don’t frighten me:</p>
<p>With such treasures I can truly serve <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Still, my good friend, a time may come, <span class="line-number">1690</span></p>
<p>When one prefers to eat what’s good in peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> When I lie quiet in bed, at ease.</p>
<p>Then let my time be done!</p>
<p>If you fool me, with flatteries,</p>
<p>Till my own self’s a joy to me, <span class="line-number">1695</span></p>
<p>If you snare me with luxury –</p>
<p>Let that be the last day I see!</p>
<p>That bet I’ll make!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Done!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> And quickly!</p>
<p>When, to the Moment then, I say:</p>
<p>‘Ah, stay a while! You are so lovely!’ <span class="line-number">1700</span></p>
<p>Then you can grasp me: then you may,</p>
<p>Then, to my ruin, I’ll go gladly!</p>
<p>Then they can ring the passing bell,</p>
<p>Then from your service you are free,</p>
<p>The clocks may halt, the hands be still, <span class="line-number">1705</span></p>
<p>And time be past and done, for me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Consider well, we’ll not forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You have your rights, complete:</p>
<p>I never over-estimate my powers.</p>
<p>I’ll be a slave, in defeat: <span class="line-number">1710</span></p>
<p>Why ask whose slave or yours?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Today, likewise, at the Doctors’ Feast</p>
<p>I’ll do my duty as your servant.</p>
<p>One thing, though! – Re: life and death, I want</p>
<p>A few lines from you, at the least. <span class="line-number">1715</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You pedant, you demand it now in writing?</p>
<p>You still won’t take Man’s word for anything?</p>
<p>It’s not enough that the things I say,</p>
<p>Will always accord with my future?</p>
<p>The world never ceases to wear away, <span class="line-number">1720</span></p>
<p>And shall a promise bind me, then, forever?</p>
<p>Yet that’s the illusion in our minds,</p>
<p>And who then would be free of it?</p>
<p>Happy the man, who pure truth finds,</p>
<p>And who’ll never deign to sacrifice it! <span class="line-number">1725</span></p>
<p>Still a document, written and signed,</p>
<p>That’s a ghost makes all men fear it.</p>
<p>The word is already dying in the pen,</p>
<p>And wax and leather hold the power then.</p>
<p>What do you want from me base spirit? <span class="line-number">1730</span></p>
<p>Will iron: marble: parchment: paper do it?</p>
<p>Shall I write with stylus, pen or chisel?</p>
<p>I’ll leave the whole decision up to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Why launch into oratory too?</p>
<p>Hot-tempered: you exaggerate as well. <span class="line-number">1735</span></p>
<p>Any bit of paper’s just as good.</p>
<p>And you can sign it with a drop of blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> If it will satisfy you, and it should,</p>
<p>Then let’s complete the farce in full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Blood is a quite special fluid. <span class="line-number">1740</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Have no fear I’ll break this pact!</p>
<p>The extreme I can promise you: it is</p>
<p>All the power my efforts can extract.</p>
<p>I’ve puffed myself up so highly</p>
<p>I belong in your ranks now. <span class="line-number">1745</span></p>
<p>The mighty Spirit scorns me</p>
<p>And Nature shuts me out.</p>
<p>The thread of thought has turned to dust,</p>
<p>Knowledge fills me with disgust.</p>
<p>Let the depths of sensuality <span class="line-number">1750</span></p>
<p>Satisfy my burning passion!</p>
<p>And, its impenetrable mask on,</p>
<p>Let every marvel be prepared for me!</p>
<p>Let’s plunge into time’s torrent,</p>
<p>Into the whirlpools of event! <span class="line-number">1755</span></p>
<p>Then let joy, and distress,</p>
<p>Frustration, and success,</p>
<p>Follow each other, as well they can:</p>
<p>Restless activity proves the man!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> No goal or measure’s set for you. <span class="line-number">1760</span></p>
<p>Do as you wish, nibble at everything,</p>
<p>Catch at fragments while you’re flying,</p>
<p>Enjoy it all, whatever you find to do.</p>
<p>Now grab at it, and don’t be stupid!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> It’s not joy we’re about: you heard it. <span class="line-number">1765</span></p>
<p>I’ll take the frenzy, pain-filled elation,</p>
<p>Loving hatred, enlivening frustration.</p>
<p>Cured of its urge to know, my mind</p>
<p>In future, will not hide from any pain,</p>
<p>And what is shared by all mankind, <span class="line-number">1770</span></p>
<p>In my innermost self, I’ll contain:</p>
<p>My soul will grasp the high and low,</p>
<p>My heart accumulate its bliss and woe,</p>
<p>So this self will embrace all theirs,</p>
<p>That, in the end, their fate it shares. <span class="line-number">1775</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Believe me, many a thousand year</p>
<p>They’ve chewed hard food, and yet</p>
<p>From the cradle to the bier,</p>
<p>Not one has ever digested it!</p>
<p>Trust one of us, this Whole thing <span class="line-number">1780</span></p>
<p>Was only made for a god’s delight!</p>
<p>In eternal splendour he is dwelling,</p>
<p>He placed us in the darkness quite,</p>
<p>And only gave you day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> But, <em>I </em>will! <span class="line-number">1785</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> That’s good to hear!</p>
<p>Yet I’ve a fear, just the one:</p>
<p>Time is short, and art is long.</p>
<p>I think you need instruction.</p>
<p>Join forces with a poet: use poetry,</p>
<p>Let <em>him</em> roam in imagination, <span class="line-number">1790</span></p>
<p>You’ll gain every noble quality</p>
<p>From your <em>honorary</em> occupation,</p>
<p>The lion’s brave attitude</p>
<p>The wild stag’s swiftness,</p>
<p>The Italian’s fiery blood, <span class="line-number">1795</span></p>
<p>The North’s persistence.</p>
<p>Let <em>him</em> find the mysterious</p>
<p>Meeting of generous and devious,</p>
<p>While <em>you</em>, with passions young and hot,</p>
<p>Fall in love, according to the plot. <span class="line-number">1800</span></p>
<p>I’d like to see such a gentleman, among us,</p>
<p>And I’d call him Mister Microcosmus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> What am I then, if it’s a flight too far,</p>
<p>For me to gain that human crown</p>
<p>I yearn towards with every sense I own? <span class="line-number">1805</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> In the end, you are – what you are.</p>
<p>Set your hair in a thousand curlicues</p>
<p>Place your feet in yard-high shoes,</p>
<p>You’ll remain forever, what you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> All the treasures of the human spirit <span class="line-number">1810</span></p>
<p>I feel that I’ve expended, uselessly.</p>
<p>And wherever, at the last, I sit,</p>
<p>No new power flows, in me.</p>
<p>I’m not a hair’s breadth taller, as you see,</p>
<p>And I’m no nearer to Infinity. <span class="line-number">1815</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> My dear sir, you see the thing</p>
<p>Exactly as all men see it: why,</p>
<p>We must re-order everything,</p>
<p>Before the joys of life slip by.</p>
<p>Hang it! Hands and feet, belong to you, <span class="line-number">1820</span></p>
<p>Certainly, a head, and a backside,</p>
<p>Yet everything I use as new</p>
<p>Why is my ownership of it denied?</p>
<p>When I can count on six stallions,</p>
<p>Isn’t their horsepower mine to use? <span class="line-number">1825</span></p>
<p>I drive behind, and am a proper man,</p>
<p>As though I’d twenty-four legs, too.</p>
<p>Look lively! Leave the senses be,</p>
<p>And plunge into the world with me!</p>
<p>I say to you that scholarly fellows <span class="line-number">1830</span></p>
<p>Are like the cattle on an arid heath:</p>
<p>Some evil spirit leads them round in circles,</p>
<p>While sweet green meadows lie beneath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> How shall we begin then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> From here, we’ll first win free.</p>
<p>What kind of a martyrs’ hole <em>can</em> this be? <span class="line-number">1835</span></p>
<p>What kind of a teacher of life is he,</p>
<p>Who fills young minds with ennui?</p>
<p>Let your neighbours do it, and go!</p>
<p>Do you want to thresh straw forever?</p>
<p>The best things you can ever know, <span class="line-number">1840</span></p>
<p>You dare not tell the youngsters, ever.</p>
<p>I hear one of them arriving, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I’ve no desire to see him, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> The poor lad’s waited hours for you.</p>
<p>He mustn’t go away un-consoled. <span class="line-number">1845</span></p>
<p>Come: give me your cap and gown.</p>
<p>The mask should look delicious. So!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>He disguises himself</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I’ve lost what wit’s my own!</p>
<p>I want fifteen minutes with him, only:</p>
<p>Meanwhile get ready for our journey! <span class="line-number">1850</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> (<em>In Faust’s long gown</em>.)</p>
<p>Reason and Science you despise,</p>
<p>Man’s highest powers: now the lies</p>

<p>With those magic arts that blind you,</p>
<p>And I’ll have you, totally – <span class="line-number">1855</span></p>
<p>Fate gave him such a spirit</p>
<p>It urges him ever onwards, wildly,</p>
<p>And, in his hasty striving, he has leapt</p>
<p>Beyond all earth’s ecstasies.</p>
<p>I’ll drag him through raw life, <span class="line-number">1860</span></p>
<p>Through the meaningless and shallow,</p>
<p>I’ll freeze him: stick to him: keep him ripe,</p>
<p>Frustrate his insatiable greed, allow</p>
<p>Food and drink to drift before his eyes:</p>
<p>In vain he’ll beg for consummation, <span class="line-number">1865</span></p>
<p>And if he weren’t the devil’s, why</p>
<p>He’d still go to his ruination!</p>

<p>(<em>A student enters.</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I’m only here momentarily,</p>
<p>I’ve come, filled with humility,</p>
<p>To speak to, and to stand before, <span class="line-number">1870</span></p>
<p>One who’s spoken of with awe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Your courtesy delights me greatly!</p>
<p>A man like other men you see.</p>
<p>Have you studied then, elsewhere?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I beg you, please enrol me, here! <span class="line-number">1875</span></p>
<p>I come to you strong of courage,</p>
<p>Lined in pocket, healthy for my age:</p>
<p>My mother didn’t want to lose me: though,</p>
<p>I’d like to learn what it’s right for me to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Then you’ve come to the right place, exactly. <span class="line-number">1880</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> To be honest, I’d like to go already:</p>
<p>There’s little pleasure for me at all,</p>
<p>In these walls, and all these halls.</p>
<p>It’s such a narrow space I find,</p>
<p>You see no trees, no leaves of any kind, <span class="line-number">1885</span></p>
<p>And in the lectures, on the benches,</p>
<p>All thought deserts me, and my senses.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> It will only come to you with habit.</p>
<p>So the child takes its mother’s breast</p>
<p>Quite unwillingly at first, and yet it <span class="line-number">1890</span></p>
<p>Soon sucks away at her with zest.</p>
<p>So will you at Wisdom’s breast, here,</p>
<p>Feel every day a little zestier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I’ll cling to her neck with pleasure:</p>
<p>But only tell me how to find her. <span class="line-number">1895</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Explain, before you travel on</p>
<p>What faculty you’ve settled on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I want to be a true scholar,</p>
<p>I want to grasp, by the collar,</p>
<p>What’s on earth, in heaven above, <span class="line-number">1900</span></p>
<p>In Science, and in Nature too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Then here’s the very path for you,</p>
<p>But don’t allow yourself to wander off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I’ll be present heart and soul:</p>
<p>Of course I’ll want to play, <span class="line-number">1905</span></p>
<p>Have some fun and freedom, though,</p>
<p>On each sweet summer holiday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Use your time well: it slips away so fast, yet</p>
<p>Discipline will teach you how to win it.</p>
<p>My dear friend, I’d advise, in sum, <span class="line-number">1910</span></p>
<p>First, the <em>Collegium Logicum.</em></p>
<p>There your mind will be trained,</p>
<p>As if in Spanish boots, constrained,</p>
<p>So that painfully, as it ought,</p>
<p>It creeps along the way of thought, <span class="line-number">1915</span></p>
<p>Not flitting about all over,</p>
<p>Wandering here and there.</p>
<p>So you’ll learn, in many days,</p>
<p>What you used to do, untaught, as in a haze,</p>
<p>Like eating now, and drinking, you’ll see <span class="line-number">1920</span></p>
<p>The <em>necessity</em> of One! Two! Three!</p>
<p>Truly the intricacy of logic</p>
<p>Is like a master-weaver’s fabric,</p>
<p>Where the loom holds a thousand threads,</p>
<p>Here and there the shuttles go <span class="line-number">1925</span></p>
<p>And the threads, invisibly, flow,</p>
<p>One pass serves for a thousand instead.</p>
<p>Then the philosopher steps in: he’ll show</p>
<p>That it certainly <em>had</em> to be so:</p>
<p>The first was - so, the second - so, <span class="line-number">1930</span></p>
<p>And so, the third and fourth were - so:</p>
<p>If first and second had never been,</p>
<p>Third and fourth would not be seen.</p>
<p>All praise the scholars, beyond believing,</p>
<p>But few of <em>them</em> ever turn to weaving. <span class="line-number">1935</span></p>
<p>To know and note the living, you’ll find it</p>
<p>Best to first dispense with the spirit:</p>
<p>Then with the pieces in your hand,</p>
<p>Ah! You’ve only lost the spiritual bond.</p>
<p>‘Natural treatment’, Chemistry calls it <span class="line-number">1940</span></p>
<p>Mocks at herself, and doesn’t know it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I’m not sure that I quite understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> You’ll soon know it all, as planned,</p>
<p>When you’ve learnt the science of reduction,</p>
<p>And everything’s proper classification. <span class="line-number">1945</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> After all that, I feel as stupid</p>
<p>As if I’d a mill wheel in my head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Next, before all else, you’ll fix</p>
<p>Your mind on Metaphysics!</p>
<p>See that you’re profoundly trained <span class="line-number">1950</span></p>
<p>In what <em>never</em> stirs in a human brain:</p>
<p>You’ll learn a splendid word</p>
<p>For what’s occurred or not occurred.</p>
<p>But for the present take six months</p>
<p>To get yourself in order: start at once. <span class="line-number">1955</span></p>
<p>Five hours every day, lock</p>
<p>Yourself in, with a ticking clock!</p>
<p>Make sure you’re well prepared,</p>
<p>Study each paragraph with care,</p>
<p>So afterwards you’ll be certain <span class="line-number">1960</span></p>
<p>Only what’s in the book, was written:</p>
<p>Then be as diligent when you pen it,</p>
<p>As if the Holy Ghost had said it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> You won’t need to tell me twice!</p>
<p>I think, myself, it’s very helpful, too <span class="line-number">1965</span></p>
<p>That one can take back home, and use,</p>
<p>What someone’s penned in black and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> But choose a faculty, any one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> I wouldn’t be comfortable with Law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I couldn’t name you anything more <span class="line-number">1970</span></p>
<p>Vile, I know how dogmatic it’s become.</p>
<p>Laws and rights are handed down</p>
<p>It’s an eternal disgrace:</p>
<p>They’re moved round from town to town</p>
<p>Dragged around from place to place. <span class="line-number">1975</span></p>
<p>Reason is nonsense, kindness a disease,</p>
<p>If you’re a grandchild it’s a curse!</p>
<p>The rights we are born with,</p>
<p>To those, alas, no one refers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> That just strengthens my disgust. <span class="line-number">1980</span></p>
<p>Happy the student that you instruct!</p>
<p>I’ve nearly settled on Theology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I wouldn’t wish to guide you erroneously.</p>
<p>In what that branch of knowledge concerns</p>
<p>It’s so difficult to avoid a fallacious route, <span class="line-number">1985</span></p>
<p>There’s so much poison hidden in what you learn,</p>
<p>And it’s barely distinguishable from the antidote.</p>
<p>The best thing here’s to make a single choice,</p>
<p>Then simply swear by your master’s voice</p>
<p>On the whole, to words stick fast! <span class="line-number">1990</span></p>
<p>Through the safest gate you’ll pass</p>
<p>To the Temple of Certainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> Yet surely words must have a sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Why, yes! But don’t torment yourself with worry,</p>
<p>Where sense fails it’s only necessary <span class="line-number">1995</span></p>
<p>To supply a word, and change the tense.</p>
<p>With words fine arguments can be weighted,</p>
<p>With words whole Systems can be created,</p>
<p>With words, the mind does its conceiving,</p>
<p>No word suffers a jot from thieving. <span class="line-number">2000</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> Forgive me, I delay you with my questions,</p>
<p>But I must trouble you again,</p>
<p>On the subject of Medicine,</p>
<p>Have you no helpful word to say?</p>
<p>Three years, so little time applied, <span class="line-number">2005</span></p>
<p>And, God, the field is rather wide!</p>
<p>If only you had some kind of pointer,</p>
<p>You would feel so much further on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> (<em>Aside</em>.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Aloud</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To grasp the spirit of Medicine’s easily done:</p>
<p>You study the great and little world, until,</p>
<p>In the end you let it carry on</p>
<p>Just as God wills.</p>
<p>Useless to roam round, scientifically: <span class="line-number">2015</span></p>
<p>Everyone learns only what he can:</p>
<p>The one who grasps the Moment fully,</p>
<p>He’s the proper man.</p>
<p>You’re quite a well-made fellow,</p>
<p>You’re not short of courage too, <span class="line-number">2020</span></p>
<p>And when you’re easy with yourself,</p>
<p>Others will be easy with you.</p>
<p>Study, especially, female behaviour:</p>
<p>Their eternal aches and woes,</p>
<p>All of the thousand-fold, <span class="line-number">2025</span></p>
<p>Rise from one point, and have one cure.</p>
<p>And if you’re half honourable about it</p>
<p>You shall have them in your pocket.</p>
<p>A title first: to give them comfort you</p>
<p>Have skills that far exceed the others, <span class="line-number">2030</span></p>
<p>Then you’re free to touch the goods, and view</p>
<p>What someone else has prowled around for years.</p>
<p>Take the pulse firmly, you understand,</p>
<p>And then, with sidelong fiery glance,</p>
<p>Grasp the slender hips, in haste, <span class="line-number">2035</span></p>
<p>To find out whether she’s tight-laced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Student</span> That sounds much better! The Where and How, I see.</p>

<p>I feel so small next to other men,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> My friend, just give yourself completely to it:</p>

<p>I see not one servant, coach, or horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> We’ll just spread this cloak wide open, <span class="line-number">2065</span></p>
<p>Then through the air we’ll take our course.</p>

<p>Better not take much baggage along.</p>
<p>A little hot air I’ll ready, first,</p>
<p>To lift us nimbly above the Earth, <span class="line-number">2070</span></p>
<p>And as we’re light we’ll soon get clear:</p>

<p>Drinking life’s last glow:</p>
<p>Then threw the golden goblet</p>

<p>It’s quite miraculous! What can it hold in store? <span class="line-number">2785</span></p>
<p>Perhaps someone brought it as security,</p>

<p>There’s a ribbon hanging from it, there’s a key,</p>
<p>I’m quite determined to open it.</p>
<p>What’s here? Heavens! What a show, <span class="line-number">2790</span></p>
<p>More than I’ve ever seen in all my days!</p>
<p>A jewel box! A noble lady might glow</p>
<p>With all of these on high holidays!</p>
<p>How would this chain look? This display</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>She puts the jewellery on and stands in front of the mirror</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only the earrings were mine!</p>
<p>At once one looks so different.</p>
<p>What makes us beautiful, young blood?</p>
<p>All that’s fine and good,</p>
<p>But it’s discounted, in the end, <span class="line-number">2800</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> In his last wanderings, he was rambling,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> One good turn deserves another, true.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> We only have to bear a valid witness,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Brilliant! We must first make the journey there!</p>

<p>Of God, the World, what’s in it, Men,</p>
<p>What moves them, in mind and breast? <span class="line-number">3045</span></p>
<p>With impudent brow, and swollen chest?</p>
<p>And if you look at it more deeply, oh yes,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You are, and you’ll remain, a Liar and a Sophist. <span class="line-number">3050</span></p>

<p>Won’t you beguile poor Gretchen so:</p>
<p>And swear you love her with all your soul?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> From my heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Well, and good! <span class="line-number">3055</span></p>
<p>And will your eternal Truth and Love,</p>
<p>Your one all-powerful Force, above –</p>
<p>Flow from your heart, too, as it should?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Stop! Stop! It will! If I but feel,</p>
<p>For that emotion, for that throng, <span class="line-number">3060</span></p>
<p>Seek the name, that none reveal,</p>
<p>Roam, with senses, through the world.</p>
<p>Seize on every highest word,</p>
<p>And call the fire, that I’m tasting,</p>
<p>Endless, eternal, everlasting – <span class="line-number">3065</span></p>
<p>Does that to some devil’s game of lies belong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Yet, I’m still right!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Hear one thing more,</p>

<p>Come, chattering fills me with disgust,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Yes, out of sight is out of mind!</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Dearest, believe me, what men call sense, <span class="line-number">3100</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Ah, that simplicity and innocence never know</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> It’s only for a moment that you think of me,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Yes, our household’s a little one,</p>

<p>We have no servant: I sweep, knit, sew,</p>
<p>And cook, I’m working early and late:</p>
<p>And in everything my mother is so</p>
<p>Strict, and straight.</p>
<p>Not that she has to be quite so economical: <span class="line-number">3115</span></p>
<p>We could be more generous than others:</p>
<p>My father left a little fortune for us:</p>
<p>A house and garden by the town-wall.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> I raised her, and she loved me too. <span class="line-number">3125</span></p>
<p>After my father died, she was born,</p>
<p>We gave mother up for lost, so worn</p>
<p>And wretchedly she lay there then,</p>
<p>And slowly, day by day, grew well again.</p>
<p>She couldn’t think of feeding <span class="line-number">3130</span></p>
<p>It herself: that poor little thing,</p>
<p>And so I nursed it all alone,</p>
<p>On milk and water, as if it were my own,</p>
<p>In my arms, in my lap,</p>
<p>It charmed me, tumbling, and grew fat. <span class="line-number">3135</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You found your greatest happiness there, for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> But also truly many a weary hour.</p>
<p>The baby’s cradle stood at night</p>
<p>Beside my bed: and if it hardly stirred</p>
<p>I woke outright: <span class="line-number">3140</span></p>
<p>Now I nursed it, now laid it beside me: heard</p>
<p>When it cried, and left my bed, and often</p>
<p>Danced it back and forth, in the room: and then,</p>
<p>At break of dawn stood at the washtub, again:</p>
<p>Then the market and the kitchen, oh, <span class="line-number">3145</span></p>
<p>And every day just like tomorrow.</p>
<p>One sometimes lacks the courage, sir, and yet</p>
<p>One appreciates one’s food and rest.</p>

<p>No one could ever say anything bad about me.</p>

<p>I confess, I didn’t know what it was, though, <span class="line-number">3175</span></p>
<p>That I began to feel, and to your advantage too,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> An other-worldly pleasure.</p>
<p>Night and day, mountains for leisure.</p>
<p>Clasping heaven and earth, blissfully,</p>
<p>Inflating yourself, becoming a deity. <span class="line-number">3285</span></p>
<p>With expectant urge burrowing through earth’s core,</p>
<p>Feeling all that six days’ work, in yours,</p>
<p>To taste who knows what, in power’s pride,</p>
<p>Overflowing, almost, with the joy of life,</p>
<p>Vanishing, the Earthly Son, <span class="line-number">3290</span></p>
<p>And into some deep Intuition –</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>With a gesture</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t say how – passing inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Fie, on you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Ah, you don’t like it from me!</p>
<p>You’ve the right, to say ‘fie’ to me, politely.</p>
<p>Before chaste ears men daren’t speak aloud, <span class="line-number">3295</span></p>
<p>That which chaste hearts can’t do without:</p>
<p>Short and sweet, I begrudge the pleasure you get</p>
<p>From occasionally lying to yourself, about it.</p>
<p>But you won’t hold out for long, I’m sure.</p>
<p>You’re already over-driven, <span class="line-number">3300</span></p>
<p>Sooner or later you’ll be given</p>
<p>To madness, or to fear and horror.</p>
<p>Enough! Your lover sits inside,</p>
<p>All is dull, oppressive to her,</p>
<p>She can’t get you out of her mind, <span class="line-number">3305</span></p>
<p>Her deep love overwhelms her.</p>
<p>First your love’s flood round her flowed,</p>
<p>As a stream pours from melted snow:</p>
<p>You’ve so filled her heart, and now,</p>
<p>Your stream again is shallow. <span class="line-number">3310</span></p>
<p>Instead of enthroning yourself in the wood,</p>
<p>Let the great gentleman do some good,</p>
<p>To that poor little ape of flesh and blood,</p>
<p>And reward her, I think, for her love.</p>
<p>Her days seem pitifully long: <span class="line-number">3315</span></p>
<p>She sits at the window, cloud drifting</p>
<p>Over the old City wall, sees it lifting.</p>
<p>‘Would I were a little bird!’ runs her song,</p>
<p>All day long, and all night long.</p>
<p>Sometimes lively, mostly not, <span class="line-number">3320</span></p>
<p>Sometimes crying out, in tears,</p>
<p>Then quiet again, it appears,</p>
<p>And always in love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You snake! You snake, you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> A touch! That caught you! <span class="line-number">3325</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Wretch! Be gone from my presence:</p>
<p>Don’t name that lovely girl to me!</p>
<p>Don’t bring desire for that sweet body</p>
<p>Before every half-maddened sense!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Well, what then? She thinks you’ve flown away, <span class="line-number">3330</span></p>
<p>And, half and half, you already have, I’d say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I’m near her, and were I still far,</p>
<p>I can’t lose her or forget her,</p>
<p>I even envy the body of our Lord,</p>
<p>When her lips touch it at the altar. <span class="line-number">3335</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Quite so, my friend! My envy often closes</p>
<p>On that pair of twins that feed among the roses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Away from me, procurer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Fine, you curse and I must smile.</p>
<p>The god who made both man and woman,</p>
<p>He likewise knew the noblest profession, <span class="line-number">3340</span></p>
<p>So made the opportunity as well.</p>
<p>Go on, it’s a crying shame!</p>
<p>Since you’re bound, all the same</p>
<p>For your lover’s room, not death.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Where is the heavenly joy in her arms? <span class="line-number">3345</span></p>
<p>Let me warm myself with her charms!</p>
<p>Do I not always feel her absent breath?</p>
<p>Am I not the fugitive? The homeless one?</p>
<p>The creature without aim or rest,</p>
<p>A torrent in the rocks, still thundering down, <span class="line-number">3350</span></p>
<p>Foaming eagerly into the abyss?</p>
<p>And she beside it, with vague childlike mind,</p>
<p>In a hut there, on a little Alpine field,</p>
<p>So, her first homely life you’d find,</p>
<p>Hidden there in that little world. <span class="line-number">3355</span></p>
<p>And I, the god-forsaken,</p>
<p>Was not great enough,</p>
<p>To grasp the cliffs, and take them,</p>
<p>And crush them into dust!</p>
<p>I still must undermine her peaceful life! <span class="line-number">3360</span></p>
<p>You, Hell, must have your sacrifice.</p>
<p>Help, Devil, curtail the anxious moment brewing.</p>
<p>What must be, let it be, and swiftly!</p>
<p>Let her fate also fall on me,</p>
<p>And she <em>and</em> I rush to ruin! <span class="line-number">3365</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Again it glows: again it seethes!</p>
<p>Go in and comfort her, you fool!</p>
<p>When a brain, like yours, no exit sees,</p>
<p>It calls it the end of all things, too.</p>
<p>Praise him who keeps his courage fresh! <span class="line-number">3370</span></p>
<p>Or you’ll soon get quite be-devilled, there.</p>
<p>I find nothing in the world so tasteless,</p>
<p>As a Devil, in despair.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Say, as regards religion, how you feel. <span class="line-number">3415</span></p>
<p>I know that you are a dear, good man,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Leave that alone, child! You feel I’m kind to you:</p>
<p>For Love I’d give my blood, my life too.</p>
<p>I’ll rob no man of his church and faith. <span class="line-number">3420</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> That’s not right, we <em>must</em> have faith.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Must we?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Ah, if in this I was only fluent!</p>
<p>You don’t respect the Holy Sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I respect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Without wanting it, though. You’ve passed</p>
<p>So many years without confession, or mass. <span class="line-number">3425</span></p>
<p>Do you believe in God?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> My darling, who dare say:</p>

<p>Choose priest to ask, or sage,</p>
<p>The answer would seem a joke, would it not,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> So, you don’t believe? <span class="line-number">3430</span></p>

<p>Self-revealing,</p>
<p>Says: ‘I don’t believe’?</p>

<p>Don’t the heavens arch above us?</p>

<p>Are not my eyes reflected in yours?</p>
<p>And don’t all things press</p>

<p>Fill your heart from it: it is so vast,</p>

<p>Call it then what you wish,</p>

<p>I have no name <span class="line-number">3455</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> That’s all well and good, I know,</p>
<p>The priest says much the same, <span class="line-number">3460</span></p>
<p>Only, in slightly different words.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> It’s what all hearts, say, everywhere</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Listening to you, it almost seems quite fine,</p>

<p>I’ve thought him a rogue, all along!</p>
<p>God forgive me, if I do him wrong!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> There have to be such odd fellows.</p>

<p>Once he’s inside the door, again, <span class="line-number">3485</span></p>
<p>He looks around in a mocking way,</p>
<p>And half-severely:</p>
<p>You can see he’s not at all in sympathy:</p>
<p>It’s written on his forehead even,</p>
<p>That there’s no spirit of love within. <span class="line-number">3490</span></p>
<p>I’m so happy in your arms,</p>
<p>Free, untroubled, and so warm,</p>
<p>Yet I’m stifled in his presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You angel, full of presentiments!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> It oppresses me, so deeply, too, <span class="line-number">3495</span></p>
<p>That when he meets with us, wherever,</p>
<p>I feel that I no longer love you.</p>
<p>Ah I can’t pray when he’s there,</p>
<p>And that gnaws inside me: oh,</p>
<p>Heinrich, for you too, surely it’s so. <span class="line-number">3500</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> It’s merely an antipathy!</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Ah, will there never be</p>

<p>And heart to heart, and soul, to soul impart?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Margaret</span> Ah, if I only slept alone! <span class="line-number">3505</span></p>
<p>For you, I’d gladly draw the bolt tonight:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You angel: no need for that. <span class="line-number">3510</span></p>
<p>Here is a little phial to keep!</p>
<p>Three drops of this, in her drink, she’ll take,</p>

<p>Perhaps, that it’s the Devil it conceals.</p>
<p>So, tonight? –</p>

<p>And the cliffs bow down before us,</p>
<p>And their long and rocky noses,</p>
<p>How they whistle and blow, for us! <span class="line-number">3880</span></p>
<p>Through the stones, and through the grasses,</p>
<p>Stream and streamlet, downward, hurrying.</p>
<p>Is that rustling? Is that singing?</p>
<p>Do I hear sweet lovers’ sighing,</p>
<p>Heavenly days, is that their babbling? <span class="line-number">3885</span></p>

<p>Over sand and rock all bent, <span class="line-number">3895</span></p>
<p>Stretches with a strange intent,</p>

<p>Fibrous tentacles. And mice <span class="line-number">3900</span></p>
<p>Multi-coloured, lemming-wise,</p>

<p>And all the fire-flies glowing,</p>

<p>Sweet peace then whispers softly,</p>

<p>What a din the daylight’s bringing!</p>
<p>Trombone- and trumpeting,</p>

<p>Slip into the flowers presence, <span class="line-number">4675</span></p>
<p>Deeper, deeper, lie there silent,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Life’s pulses beating now, with new existence,</p>
<p>Greet the mild ethereal half-light round me: <span class="line-number">4680</span></p>
<p>You, Earth, stood firm tonight, as well: I sense</p>
<p>Your breath is quickening all the things about me,</p>
<p>Already, with that joy you give, beginning</p>
<p>To stir the strengthening resolution in me,</p>
<p>That strives, forever, towards highest Being. – <span class="line-number">4685</span></p>
<p>Now the world unfolds, in half-light’s gleam,</p>
<p>The wood’s alive, its thousand harmonies singing,</p>
<p>While through the valleys, misted ribbons stream:</p>
<p>And heavenly light now penetrates the deep:</p>
<p>Twigs, branches shoot, with fresher life it seems, <span class="line-number">4690</span></p>
<p>From fragrant gulfs, where they were sunk in sleep:</p>
<p>Colour on colour lifts now from the ground,</p>
<p>As leaf and flower with trembling dewdrops weep –</p>
<p>And a paradise reveals itself, all round.</p>
<p>Gaze upwards! – The vast mountain heights <span class="line-number">4695</span></p>
<p>Already with the solemn hour resound:</p>
<p>They are the first to enjoy the eternal light</p>
<p>That later, for us, will work its way below.</p>
<p>Now, to the sloping Alpine meadows bright,</p>
<p>It gives a fresh clarity, a newer glow, <span class="line-number">4700</span></p>
<p>And step by step it reaches us down here: –</p>
<p>It blazes out! – Ah, already blinded, though</p>
<p>I turn away, my eyesight wounded, pierced.</p>
<p>So it is, when to the thing we yearn for</p>
<p>The highest wish so intimately rehearsed, <span class="line-number">4705</span></p>
<p>We find fulfilment opening wide the door:</p>
<p>And then, from eternal space, there breaks</p>
<p>A flood of flame, we stand amazed before:</p>
<p>We wished to set the torch of life ablaze,</p>
<p>A sea of fire consumes us, and such fire! <span class="line-number">4710</span></p>
<p>Love, is it, then? Or hate? This fierce embrace,</p>
<p>The joy and pain of alternating pyres,</p>
<p>So that, gazing back to earth again,</p>
<p>We seek to veil ourselves in youth’s desire.</p>
<p>Let the sun shine on, behind me, then! <span class="line-number">4715</span></p>
<p>The waterfall that splits the cliffs’ broad edge,</p>
<p>I gaze at with a growing pleasure, when</p>
<p>A thousand torrents plunge from ledge to ledge,</p>
<p>And still a thousand more pour down that stair,</p>
<p>Spraying the bright foam skywards from their beds. <span class="line-number">4720</span></p>
<p>And in lone splendour, through the tumult there,</p>
<p>The rainbow’s arch of colour, bending brightly,</p>
<p>Is clearly marked, and then dissolved in air,</p>
<p>Around it the cool showers, falling lightly.</p>
<p>There the efforts of mankind they mirror. <span class="line-number">4725</span></p>
<p>Reflect on it, you’ll understand precisely:</p>
<p>We live our life amongst refracted colour.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> So now, my faithful and beloved,</p>

<p>We meet beneath a lucky star,</p>
<p>Since health and luck are written above.</p>
<p>But tell me, why in days like these, <span class="line-number">4765</span></p>
<p>When we’ve conquered care,</p>
<p>And carnival masks are all our wear,</p>
<p>And delightful things are waiting,</p>
<p>We trouble ourselves with debating?</p>
<p>Yet since you say we have to do it, <span class="line-number">4770</span></p>
<p>It’s settled then, and we’ll go to it.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Chancellor</span> The highest virtue, like a sacred halo</p>

<p>What all ask, yet wish they could do without,</p>
<p>The people look to him to hand it out.</p>
<p>But ah! What help can human wit deliver,</p>
<p>Or kindly heart, or willing hand, if fever</p>
<p>Rages wildly through the state, and evil <span class="line-number">4780</span></p>
<p>Itself is broodingly preparing evil?</p>
<p>Look about, from this height’s extreme,</p>
<p>Across the realm: it seems like some bad dream,</p>
<p>Where one deformity acts on another,</p>
<p>Where lawlessness by law is furthered, <span class="line-number">4785</span></p>
<p>And an age of crime is discovered.</p>
<p>Here one steals cattle, there, a wife,</p>
<p>Cross, cup and candlestick, from the altar,</p>
<p>And boasts of it for many a year,</p>
<p>His skin’s intact, and so’s his life. <span class="line-number">4790</span></p>
<p>Then they take their claims to court</p>
<p>The judge, in pomp, on his high cushion,</p>
<p>Meanwhile there grows a furious roar,</p>
<p>From swelling tides of revolution.</p>
<p>They insist it’s crime and disgrace, <span class="line-number">4795</span></p>
<p>With their accomplices beside them,</p>
<p>And ‘Guilty!’ is the verdict in a case,</p>
<p>Only where Innocence is its own defence.</p>
<p>So all the world will slash and chop,</p>
<p>Destroying just what suits themselves: <span class="line-number">4800</span></p>
<p>How then can that true sense develop</p>
<p>That shows the morally acceptable?</p>
<p>At last the well-intentioned man</p>
<p>Yields to the bribe, the flatterer:</p>
<p>And the judge who can’t convict, is hand <span class="line-number">4805</span></p>

<p>Ah, ha! I’ve come just in time,</p>

<p>Her up there: Queen Victory. <span class="line-number">5460</span></p>
<p>With her pair of snowy wings,</p>
<p>She’s an eagle, she must think:</p>
<p>And that whenever she’s on hand,</p>
<p>To her belong the folk and land:</p>
<p>But when famous deeds are done, <span class="line-number">5465</span></p>
<p>At once I’m here with armour on,</p>
<p>When low is high, and high is low,</p>
<p>Bent is straight, and straight not so,</p>
<p>That alone fills me with mirth,</p>
<p>I wish it so throughout the Earth. <span class="line-number">5470</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> So I’ll lend you, dog from birth,</p>

<p>Twist and turn now: it’s no joke! –</p>

<p>Rolls into a foul lumpish shape! <span class="line-number">5475</span></p>
<p>A wonder – the lump’s an egg, on cue,</p>
<p>It swells and then it cracks in two:</p>
<p>Now a pair of twins appear,</p>
<p>An adder and a bat roll clear.</p>
<p>One through the dust is swiftly winding, <span class="line-number">5480</span></p>
<p>The black one’s flitting round the ceiling.</p>
<p>They hurry outside, in company,</p>

<p>None of us are injured though – <span class="line-number">5490</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> Since I play the herald’s role,</p>

<p>But I can’t easily announce</p>
<p>What cannot be understood:</p>
<p>Help me explain it, if you would! – <span class="line-number">5510</span></p>

<p>A splendid chariot, a four-in-hand,</p>
<p>Rolling through them, where they stand:</p>
<p>But it doesn’t split the people,</p>
<p>I see no one’s crushed at all. <span class="line-number">5515</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> So try!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> I must confess <span class="line-number">5535</span></p>
<p>To young and handsome, before the rest.</p>
<p>You’re a half-grown boy: yet a woman</p>

<p>You seem to me a wooer, in future,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> Let’s hear more! Go on: go on,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> Dark eyes that shine: night-black hair</p>

<p>With purple hem its glittering shows!</p>
<p>One might take you for a girl:</p>
<p>Yet for good or ill, you’d be,</p>

<p>She’d teach you your ABC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> And he, who like a splendid vision,</p>
<p>Sits on the chariot, enthroned there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> He seems a king, a rich and kind one,</p>
<p>Blessed are they who gain his favour! <span class="line-number">5555</span></p>
<p>He has no further need to strive,</p>
<p>His eyes observe whatever’s lacking,</p>
<p>And to spread his pure delight,</p>
<p>Is more to him than joy and owning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> You daren’t stop there: what you see, <span class="line-number">5560</span></p>
<p>You must describe it precisely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> I can’t express all the dignity.</p>
<p>But the glowing moon face, I see,</p>
<p>The full mouth, the bright cheeks, then</p>
<p>That shine beneath the jewelled turban: <span class="line-number">5565</span></p>
<p>Rich comfort in the clothes he’s wearing!</p>
<p>What shall I say about his bearing?</p>
<p>As a ruler he seems known to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> Plutus the God of Riches, this is he!</p>
<p>He’s come himself in all his splendour, <span class="line-number">5570</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> Explain your own <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> to me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> I am Extravagance: I am Poetry:</p>
<p>I am the Poet, who is self-perfected</p>

<p>Yet I’m immeasurably wealthy,</p>
<p>Like Plutus, worth as much as he,</p>
<p>I adorn, enliven, dance and feast,</p>
<p>And whatever he lacks, I complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Herald</span> Your boasting makes you handsomer, <span class="line-number">5580</span></p>
<p>But let’s see all your skill appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> Just watch me snap my fingers, now,</p>
<p>The chariot will gleam and glow.</p>
<p>There a string of pearls appear!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>He continues to snap his fingers, in all directions</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golden jewels for neck and ear: <span class="line-number">5585</span></p>
<p>Flawless combs and diadems,</p>
<p>Set in a ring, rare precious gems:</p>
<p>I scatter flames too, here and there,</p>
<p>Waiting for their chance to flare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Herald</span> How the dear crowd snatch, I see! <span class="line-number">5590</span></p>
<p>The giver’s soon in difficulty.</p>
<p>He snaps out jewels, as in a dream,</p>
<p>And they all snatch them, in a stream.</p>
<p>But now a different trick, you see:</p>
<p>What each has grasped so eagerly, <span class="line-number">5595</span></p>
<p>Has gained him but a poor reward,</p>
<p>The gifts already fluttering skyward.</p>
<p>The pearls are loosened from their band,</p>
<p>And beetles crawl there in his hand,</p>
<p>The poor man shakes them off, instead <span class="line-number">5600</span></p>
<p>They’re humming now around his head.</p>
<p>Another, for some solid thing,</p>
<p>Catches at a butterfly’s wing.</p>
<p>That’s what the rascal’s promise means:</p>
<p>He only lends them golden gleams! <span class="line-number">5605</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> You know how to announce masks: it’s true,</p>
<p>But it’s not the herald’s task to search below</p>
<p>The outer surface of existence:</p>
<p>That requires a keener sense.</p>
<p>Still I’m wary of all disputes. <span class="line-number">5610</span></p>
<p>Lord, I’ll direct my speech and questioning to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Turning towards Plutus</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you not trusted me with the task, to stand</p>
<p>And guide the tempest of your four-in-hand?</p>
<p>Don’t I steer well, as you direct?</p>
<p>Am I not there, when you expect? <span class="line-number">5615</span></p>
<p>And don’t I know how to win</p>
<p>The palm, for you, on daring wing?</p>
<p>When I’ve fought for you in war, now,</p>
<p>I’ve been successful every time:</p>
<p>When laurel wreaths adorn your brow <span class="line-number">5620</span></p>
<p>Have I not fashioned them with hand and mind?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Plutus</span> If I’m required to be a witness to it,</p>
<p>I’d say: You are the spirit of my spirit.</p>
<p>You always act according to my wishes,</p>
<p>And as I gain myself, you too are richer. <span class="line-number">5625</span></p>
<p>To reward your services, I value now</p>
<p>The green branch higher than my crown.</p>
<p>One true word, then, for everyone:</p>
<p>I’ve found delight in you, dear Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Boy Charioteer</span> The greatest gifts from my hand, <span class="line-number">5630</span></p>

<p>Of some little flame I throw:</p>
<p>Leaping from one brow to another,</p>
<p>Halts on him, then leaves his brother, <span class="line-number">5635</span></p>
<p>But rarely does the flame-let rise,</p>
<p>And briefly flower in bright skies:</p>
<p>For many, before they know, it’s vanished,</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s burnt out, and finished.</p>

<p>It’s your own fault that we need them.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Where is the path?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I think you might spare the speeches then:</p>

<p>Into the wild, into the solitary,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> And if you’d swum through every ocean,</p>

<p>The green still seas, the leaping dolphin:</p>
<p>Seen clouds go by, Sun, Moon and star – <span class="line-number">6245</span></p>
<p>You’ll see none in the endless void, afar,</p>
<p>Hear not a single footstep fall,</p>
<p>Find no firm place to rest at all.</p>

<p>Eternal minds in eternal recreation.</p>
<p>Images of all creatures float, portrayed:</p>
<p>They’ll not see you: they only see a shade. <span class="line-number">6290</span></p>
<p>Be of good heart, the danger there is great,</p>
<p>Go to the tripod: don’t hesitate,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> (<em>Watching him</em>.)</p>
<p> That’s right!</p>
<p>It will close itself, and follow as a servant might:</p>
<p>Exalted by your good luck, you’ll calmly rise, <span class="line-number">6295</span></p>
<p>And be back with it, before you’ve blinked your eyes.</p>
<p>And, once you’ve brought it here all right,</p>
<p>Call the Hero and Heroine from the night,</p>
<p>The first man who has ever achieved it:</p>
<p>It’s done, and you’re the one who did it. <span class="line-number">6300</span></p>

<p>In your name, Mothers, you enthroned</p>

<p>Float round your heads, active, not alive. <span class="line-number">6430</span></p>
<p>Whatever was, in all its glow and gleam,</p>
<p>Moves there still, since it must always be.</p>
<p>And you assign it, with omnipotent might,</p>
<p>To day’s pavilion or the vault of night.</p>
<p>Life holds some fast on its sweet track, <span class="line-number">6435</span></p>
<p>Others the bold magician must bring back:</p>

<p>And now behold a spirit-masterpiece!</p>
<p>As it moves about, there’s music without cease.</p>
<p>In heavenly tones, pours out a who-knows-how, <span class="line-number">6445</span></p>
<p>And while it moves, all’s turned to melody now.</p>
<p>The pillared shafts, even the tri-glyph, ringing</p>
<p>I think that the whole temple’s singing.</p>
<p>The dark sinks down: from the light mist,</p>
<p>A handsome youth steps out in time to it. <span class="line-number">6450</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Looking around him</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look upwards, here, around me, <span class="line-number">6570</span></p>
<p>All’s unaltered, and undamaged:</p>
<p>Stained glass, there, shows darkly,</p>
<p>Spiders have added to their webs:</p>
<p>The ink is dry: the paper’s yellow,</p>
<p>But everything’s still in its place: <span class="line-number">6575</span></p>
<p>Even the quill-pen’s here, on show,</p>
<p>With which Faust and the Devil embraced.</p>
<p>Yes! Deeper in the nib there’s still</p>
<p>A drop of blood, I tempted him to spill.</p>
<p>It’s a unique piece, in my book, <span class="line-number">6580</span></p>
<p>So I’ll wish the great collectors luck.</p>
<p>The old fur-robe, on the hook, too,</p>
<p>Reminds me of a joke or two,</p>
<p>That time when I taught the student,</p>
<p>What, perhaps, in youth, he’s glad he learnt. <span class="line-number">6585</span></p>
<p>Truly the same desire is on me, for</p>
<p>You, smoke-singed gown: you and I,</p>
<p>To flaunt ourselves once more as a professor,</p>
<p>And speak as one who’s always in the right.</p>
<p>How to achieve that all the learned know: <span class="line-number">6590</span></p>
<p>It’s something the Devil lost long ago.</p>

<p>Crowds, around him, panting, gather</p>

<p>Alone, he shines there at the rostrum.</p>

<p>Sits a darkly bright one still!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With astonishment now, nearer,</p>
<p>See him sitting in his dark fur,</p>
<p>Truly, as I left him sitting <span class="line-number">6715</span></p>
<p>Still in all his coarse wrapping!</p>
<p>Then he seemed a fount of wisdom,</p>
<p>Since I didn’t understand him.</p>
<p>He won’t find me so today,</p>
<p>Fresh and new, I’m on my way! <span class="line-number">6720</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sir, if in Lethe’s melancholy stream</p>
<p>That bald nodding head’s not swum,</p>
<p>See your grateful scholar come,</p>
<p>Outgrown, his academic dream.</p>
<p>I find you now, as I saw you: <span class="line-number">6725</span></p>
<p>I was another though: that’s true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I’m glad the ringing brought you.</p>
<p>I rated you once before as high:</p>

<p>Your curly hair and pointed collar,</p>
<p>Made you a childishly pleasing scholar.</p>
<p>You never wore pigtails I believe? –</p>
<p>And today you’re cropped like a Swede.</p>
<p>I see you’re bold and resolute: <span class="line-number">6735</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Baccalaureus</span> I find it arrogant that in times like these,</p>

<p>The daylight decked my path to greet me,</p>
<p>The Earth flowered, grew green, to meet me.</p>
<p>At my command, in primal night,</p>
<p>The stars in splendour swam to sight. <span class="line-number">6800</span></p>
<p>Who, but I, loosed from its prison</p>
<p>Cramped thought’s philistinism?</p>
<p>I, quite free, as my spirit cites,</p>

<p>Yet there’s no danger from him, you see,</p>

<p>In the end it changes into wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>To the younger members of the audience, who do not applaud</em>.)</p>

<p>My words have left you cold, I gather,</p>

<p>First in a near, and then a further field,</p>

<p>(<em>He turns again to the furnace</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be! The mass is clearer! <span class="line-number">6855</span></p>
<p>The proof comes nearer, nearer:</p>
<p>What man praises in deepest Nature,</p>
<p>Through Reason we dare to probe it,</p>
<p>And what she organises, here,</p>

<p>Now that this mystery’s visible to each.</p>

<p>Stick tight, as if there’ll be no separation, <span class="line-number">6895</span></p>
<p>Yet always cause each other irritation.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Homunculus</span> (<em>Astonished</em>.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lovely surroundings! – Clear water</p>
<p>In thick forest! Women there: undressing.</p>
<p>The loveliest of all! – It’s getting clearer. <span class="line-number">6905</span></p>
<p>One’s left, different from the rest, gleaming:</p>
<p>Of highest race, for sure, a heavenly name.</p>
<p>She places her foot in the transparent glow,</p>
<p>Her noble body’s sweetly living flame</p>
<p>Cools itself in the yielding crystal flow. – <span class="line-number">6910</span></p>
<p>But what’s that rush of beating wings for:</p>
<p>That thrashing, splashing, in the mirror?</p>
<p>The lovely girls, intimidated, flee:</p>
<p>Their queen, alone, looks on, composedly,</p>
<p>To see, with a proud feminine pleasure, <span class="line-number">6915</span></p>
<p>The Swan-Prince press against her knee, there,</p>
<p>Forward yet tame. Familiar, he seems. –</p>
<p>But suddenly a vapour heaves,</p>
<p>And covers, with the veil it weaves,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> All the things that you could murmur!</p>

<p>You’re at home with darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>He gazes around</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown repulsive, mildewed walls,</p>
<p>Low, pointed arches, full of scrolls! –</p>
<p>One wakes, and gives another pain, <span class="line-number">6930</span></p>
<p>On the spot, dead then, he’ll remain.</p>
<p>Wooded founts, swans, naked beauty,</p>
<p>That was his far-sighted dream:</p>
<p>How could this place do duty!</p>
<p>I can scarcely endure the scene. <span class="line-number">6935</span></p>
<p>Carry him off!</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Which path do we take there? Already</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Oh! Enough! And keep all the fight,</p>

<p>They clash, it’s said, for Freedom’s right:</p>
<p>Seen rightly, slave with slave is all the fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Homunculus</span> Leave Mankind’s wilfulness to me, then.</p>

<p>Just ask how we can get back there again.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> There’s many a Brocken trick I could display, <span class="line-number">6970</span></p>

<p>They dazzle with the senses’ freer play: it’s true:</p>
<p>They lure the heart of man to happier sins:</p>
<p>While ours, one always finds, are gloomy things. <span class="line-number">6975</span></p>
<p>And now, what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Homunculus</span> Once you weren’t so witless:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Wagner</span> (<em>Anxiously</em>.)</p>
<p>And I?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Homunculus</span> Well, now, you</p>

<p>Unfold all your ancient parchments,</p>

<p>And place them together with due care,</p>
<p>Consider <em>What</em>, more deeply consider <em>How</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile round the world, a bit, I’ll fare,</p>
<p>And find the last dot on the ‘<em>i’, </em>for now.</p>
<p>Then the great work will see its final stage: <span class="line-number">6995</span></p>
<p>Great effort will merit great reward, you’ll see:</p>

<p>This night’s awesome feast, as so often in the past, <span class="line-number">7005</span></p>
<p>I enter now, I, Erichtho, the gloomy one:</p>
<p>Not so abominable as the wretched poets</p>
<p>Painted me, with excessive slander…they never</p>
<p>Cease their blame or praise…I see the valley whiten</p>
<p>With waves of tents that gleam greyer in the distance, <span class="line-number">7010</span></p>
<p>The after-image of that anxious, fearful night.</p>
<p>How often it’s repeated! In eternity</p>
<p>Acted out, again, forever…No one gives the realm</p>
<p>To another: to the one whose power won it:</p>
<p>Whose strength rules. Since each, incapable of ruling <span class="line-number">7015</span></p>
<p>His inner self, would gladly rule his neighbour’s will,</p>
<p>In the manner that his proud mind dictates to him…</p>
<p>But here a great instance was fought out, to the end,</p>
<p>Of how force may battle against a greater force,</p>
<p>Freedom’s lovely thousand-blossomed garland be torn, <span class="line-number">7020</span></p>
<p>And stubborn laurel be wound round the ruler’s brow.</p>
<p>Here, Pompey dreams of his youth and former greatness,</p>
<p>There, Caesar, listening, watches the balance tremble!</p>
<p>It settles, and the world knows whom it sinks towards.</p>
<p>The watch fires, glowing, send out their crimson flames: <span class="line-number">7025</span></p>
<p>The field exhales those images of squandered blood,</p>
<p>And lured by the strange wondrous splendour of the night,</p>
<p>A legion of Hellenic legends gather here.</p>
<p>They hover around all the fires uncertainly,</p>
<p>Or sit nearby, the fabled forms of ancient days…. <span class="line-number">7030</span></p>
<p>The Moon, not full it is true, but of clearest light,</p>
<p>Rises, scattering mild radiance everywhere:</p>
<p>The ghostly tents vanish: the fires burn bluish now.</p>
<p>But, over my head, what sudden meteor’s this?</p>
<p>It shines, illuminates the material globe. <span class="line-number">7035</span></p>
<p>I smell Life. It’s not fitting for me to approach</p>
<p>Closer to the living, since I’m harmful to them:</p>
<p>It gives me a bad name, and is no benefit to me.</p>
<p>It sinks down already. I give way, thoughtfully!</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> Among the Argonauts, in my day, <span class="line-number">7365</span></p>

<p>Castor and Pollux always conquered,</p>
<p>When youth and beauty were honoured. <span class="line-number">7370</span></p>
<p>In determination, and swift help to others,</p>
<p>First was Calais, and Zetes his brother,</p>
<p>Thoughtful, clever, strong, well-advised,</p>
<p>Jason conquered, woman-folk’s delight.</p>
<p>Then Orpheus: gentle, always brooding, <span class="line-number">7375</span></p>
<p>Sounding the lyre, quite over-powering.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed Lynceus, by night and day,</p>
<p>Steering the sacred ship past reef and bay…</p>
<p>Let such dangers always be faced as brothers:</p>
<p>If one achieves he’s praised by all the others. <span class="line-number">7380</span></p>

<p>What all men praise as divine.</p>
<p>He was born a king, no other,</p>
<p>A splendid youth to gaze upon:</p>
<p>Yielding to his elder brother,</p>
<p>And the loveliest of women. <span class="line-number">7390</span></p>
<p>Gaea’s never known a second,</p>
<p>Nor Hebe led such on to heaven’s zone:</p>
<p>In vain for him they sing the songs,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> The sculptors never caught his form, <span class="line-number">7395</span></p>
<p>However many images they made.</p>
<p>You’ve spoken of the loveliest man,</p>
<p>Now speak about the loveliest maid!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> What!…I won’t talk of woman’s beauty,</p>
<p>It’s so often a frozen mask to me: <span class="line-number">7400</span></p>
<p>I can only praise that nature, truly,</p>
<p>Flowing freely, and cheerfully.</p>
<p>Beauty’s delighted with itself:</p>
<p>Grace makes it irresistible,</p>
<p>Like Helen, whom I carried. <span class="line-number">7405</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> You carried her?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> Yes on this very back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Was I not sufficiently aroused?</p>
<p>Such a seat, now, will bring me luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> She gripped me by the mane, so,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I’m vanquished, oh, <span class="line-number">7410</span></p>
<p>Completely! Tell me, why here?</p>
<p>She is my one and only desire!</p>
<p>Carried her from where, to where?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> That’s easy to tell, since you enquire.</p>
<p>At that time, the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, <span class="line-number">7415</span></p>
<p>Freed their sister, Helen, from a nest of robbers.</p>
<p>The robbers then, not used to being conquered,</p>
<p>Regained their courage, and chased them onward.</p>
<p>The sister and brothers’ hasty course was halted</p>
<p>By all the swamps that lie below Eleusis: <span class="line-number">7420</span></p>
<p>The brothers waded: I swam over, swiftly:</p>
<p>Then she sprang off, and, stroking gently</p>
<p>My wet mane, caressed me, thanked me,</p>
<p>Confident, sweetly clever were her ways.</p>
<p>She was so charming! Youth, delighting Age! <span class="line-number">7425</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Only ten years old!…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> The philologists deceive you,</p>
<p>I see, while deceiving themselves too.</p>
<p>It’s strange that with a mythological woman,</p>
<p>Poets use her, at will, to draw our attention,</p>
<p>She can never age, is never old, <span class="line-number">7430</span></p>
<p>Cast in the same enticing mould,</p>
<p>Seduced when young, in age delights:</p>
<p>Enough, no age restricts a poet’s flights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Then let her be as if no age has bound her!</p>
<p>As Achilles on Pherae once found her, <span class="line-number">7435</span></p>
<p>Beyond all ages. What rare luck:</p>
<p>In spite of every fate, to win her love!</p>
<p>And shall I, by the strength of my yearning,</p>
<p>Not draw that unique form towards me, living,</p>
<p>That eternal being, equal to the divine, <span class="line-number">7440</span></p>
<p>Great yet tender: kind as she’s sublime.</p>
<p>You saw her once: today I too have seen her,</p>
<p>Lovely in her attraction: as lovely as desired.</p>
<p>Now my soul and being is strongly tied:</p>
<p>If I can’t win her, I shan’t survive. <span class="line-number">7445</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chiron</span> Ah, stranger! You’re enraptured like Mankind:</p>

<p>Yet now your fate is to be met with here:</p>

<p>Imploring her father to add to his fame,</p>
<p>Enlighten, at last, each rash doctor’s brain,</p>
<p>And persuade them never to deal death again…</p>
<p>I like her best of all the crowd of Sibyls, <span class="line-number">7455</span></p>
<p>Free of grimaces, kind and generous:</p>
<p>If you stay with her, she’s the power too,</p>
<p>To heal you totally: with herbs and roots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I don’t need healing: my mind is filled with power:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I’m amazed no poet’s had the intelligence <span class="line-number">7995</span></p>

<p>Where every day, as walking, living heroes,</p>

<p>Where –</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Phorkyads</span> Be silent, and don’t tempt us to roam!</p>
<p>What use would it be to us, to be better known?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> In that case, there’s little more to say:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Others</span> Let’s! – But without the tooth and eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Now you’ve denied me the best features of all: <span class="line-number">8020</span></p>
<p>How can I show your strict and perfect form?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">A Phorkyad</span> Shut one eye, that’s easy to do,</p>

<p>His home’s not far away and cavernous,</p>
<p>But his head, it’s of the very stubbornest,</p>
<p>He’s a sour-top, and quite the nastiest. <span class="line-number">8085</span></p>
<p>The whole human race can’t satisfy</p>
<p>Him, the grumbler, and needn’t try.</p>
<p>Yet to him the future is revealed,</p>
<p>And so all show respect, and yield</p>
<p>Him honour in his high position: <span class="line-number">8090</span></p>
<p>He’s done quite well by many a one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Homunculus</span> Then let’s try him, and hurry on!</p>
<p>My glass and flame won’t fail our mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Nereus</span> (<em>The sea-god</em>.)</p>
<p>Are those human voices, in my ear?</p>
<p>How quickly my deepest anger stirs! <span class="line-number">8095</span></p>
<p>Forms, reaching for the gods, in their endeavour,</p>
<p>Yet condemned to be themselves, forever.</p>
<p>In ancient times I had heavenly rest,</p>
<p>Yet drove myself to act well to the best:</p>
<p>And then, when I’d finished what I’d done, <span class="line-number">8100</span></p>
<p>It was quite clear that nothing had been won.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Thales</span> And yet, Old Man of the Sea, we trust you:</p>
<p>You’re the Wise: so don’t drive us from you!</p>
<p>See this flame, he’s almost human, really,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Nereus</span> What advice! Has Mankind valued my advice?</p>
<p>A wise word’s frozen in a stubborn ear.</p>
<p>No matter how often some harsh action strikes,</p>
<p>People remain as self-willed as before.</p>
<p>I warned Paris himself, in a fatherly way, <span class="line-number">8110</span></p>
<p>Before the foreign girl tempted him to stray.</p>
<p>He stood bravely on the shore of Greece,</p>
<p>And I told him what my Spirit could see:</p>
<p>The smoke-filled air, the streaming blood,</p>
<p>Glowing timbers, slaughter’s flood, <span class="line-number">8115</span></p>
<p>Troy’s day of judgement, caught in verse,</p>
<p>Its horrors known for ten thousand years.</p>
<p>The old man’s words seemed idle to the young,</p>
<p>He followed his need, and Ilium was gone –</p>
<p>A bloody corpse, frozen with ancient pain, <span class="line-number">8120</span></p>
<p>For Pindus’ eagles, a literary gain.</p>
<p>Ulysses too! Didn’t I tell him about</p>
<p>Circe’s wiles, that Cyclopean lout?</p>
<p>The indecision in his own shallow mind,</p>
<p>And all of it! What benefit did he find? <span class="line-number">8125</span></p>
<p>Till, late indeed, the ocean favoured him more,</p>
<p>And brought him, wave-tossed, to a friendly shore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Thales</span> Such behaviour brings the wise man pain,</p>
<p>Yet the good will chance it all again.</p>
<p>An ounce of thanks will still please them deeply, <span class="line-number">8130</span></p>

<p>From sea-horses to Neptune’s stallions,</p>
<p>Blending so sensitively with the element,</p>

<p>In a play of colours, on Venus’ chariot shell,</p>
<p>Galatea, the loveliest, comes to me, as well, <span class="line-number">8145</span></p>
<p>Who, since Cypris turned away from us,</p>
<p>Rules as the new divinity of Paphos.</p>
<p>And so, heiress, for ages now, the sweet one,</p>
<p>Holds town, and temple, chariot and throne.</p>
<p>Away! It’s time for a father’s enjoyments, <span class="line-number">8150</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center">(<em>Helen enters with the Chorus of Captive Trojan Women. Panthalis is leader of the Chorus</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> I, Helen the much admired yet much reviled,</p>
<p>Come from the shore, where recently we landed,</p>
<p>Still drunk with the violent rocking of those waves <span class="line-number">8490</span></p>
<p>That from Phrygian heights on high-arched backs,</p>
<p>By Poseidon’s favour, and the East Wind’s power,</p>
<p>Carried us here to the coast of my native land.</p>
<p>There, below us, beside his bravest soldiers</p>
<p>King Menelaus, now, celebrates his return. <span class="line-number">8495</span></p>
<p>But you, bid me welcome, you, the lofty house</p>
<p>Tyndareus my father built when he returned,</p>
<p>Close by the slope of Pallas Athene’s hill:</p>
<p>Here, where with Clytemnestra, in sisterhood, I</p>
<p>And Castor and Pollux, grew and happily played: <span class="line-number">8500</span></p>
<p>You, more nobly adorned than all Sparta’s houses.</p>
<p>Be greeted by me, you honoured double doors!</p>
<p>Once, Menelaus the shining bridegroom came</p>
<p>To me, through your friendly inviting portals,</p>
<p>I, the one singled out from among so many. <span class="line-number">8505</span></p>
<p>Open to me once more, so that I might fulfil,</p>
<p>The King’s command, truly, as a wife should.</p>
<p>Let me pass! And let everything be left behind,</p>
<p>That raged round me, till now, so full of doom.</p>
<p>For since, light in heart, I left this place behind, <span class="line-number">8510</span></p>
<p>Seeking out Venus’ temple, in sacred duty,</p>
<p>Where instead a Trojan robber abducted me,</p>
<p>Many things have happened, men, far and wide,</p>
<p>Gladly tell of, though she’s not so glad to hear them,</p>
<p>Round whom the story grew, and myth was spun. <span class="line-number">8515</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> O marvellous woman, don’t disdain</p>
<p>Inheritance of the noblest estate!</p>
<p>For the highest fate’s granted to you alone,</p>
<p>The glory of beauty that towers above all.</p>
<p>The Hero’s name sounds his advance, <span class="line-number">8520</span></p>
<p>And proudly he strides:</p>
<p>But he bows down, most stubborn of men,</p>
<p>Before conquering Beauty, in mind and sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Enough of that! I’m brought here by my husband,</p>
<p>I’ve been sent ahead by him, now, to his city: <span class="line-number">8525</span></p>
<p>But what the meaning of it is I can hardly guess.</p>
<p>Do I come as his wife? Do I come as the Queen?</p>
<p>Or a sacrifice, for a Prince’s bitter pain,</p>
<p>And the ill fortune long endured by the Greeks?</p>
<p>I’m conquered: but am I a prisoner? I can’t tell! <span class="line-number">8530</span></p>
<p>True, the Immortals appointed Fame, and Fate,</p>
<p>As the two ambiguous, doubtful companions</p>
<p>Of Beauty, to stand here at this threshold with me,</p>
<p>The gloomy, threatening presences by my side.</p>
<p>Even in the hollow ship my husband seldom <span class="line-number">8535</span></p>
<p>Gazed at me, or spoke an encouraging word.</p>
<p>He sat in front of me, as if in evil thought.</p>
<p>But scarcely had the foremost ship’s prow greeted</p>
<p>Land, in that deep bay Eurotas’ mouth has made,</p>
<p>Than he spoke to us, as the gods had urged him: <span class="line-number">8540</span></p>
<p>‘Here my soldiers will disembark in ordered ranks,</p>
<p>I’ll muster them, ranged along the ocean’s-shore:</p>
<p>But you’ll go on, ever on along the banks</p>
<p>Of sacred Eurotas, shining with bright orchards,</p>
<p>Guide the horses through gleaming water meadows, <span class="line-number">8545</span></p>
<p>Till of your lovely journey you make an end,</p>
<p>Where Lacedemon, once a rich spreading field,</p>
<p>Surrounded by austere mountains, was created.</p>
<p>Walk through the high-towered house of princes,</p>
<p>And summon the capable old Stewardess <span class="line-number">8550</span></p>
<p>Along with the maidservants I left behind,</p>
<p>Let her display the store of rich treasure to you,</p>
<p>That which your father left, and that I myself</p>
<p>Have added to, amassing it in war and peace.</p>
<p>You’ll find it all still in the most perfect order: <span class="line-number">8555</span></p>
<p>It is a prince’s privilege that he should find</p>
<p>That all is loyalty, on returning to his house,</p>
<p>All that he’s left behind still in its proper place.</p>
<p>Since no slave has the power to effect a change.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Let this treasure, so steadily massed, <span class="line-number">8560</span></p>
<p>Bring you delight, now, in eye and breast!</p>
<p>For the necklace bright, and the crown of gold,</p>
<p>Were resting, and darkening, in proud repose:</p>
<p>But enter now, and claim them all,</p>
<p>They’ll quickly respond. <span class="line-number">8565</span></p>
<p>I love to see Beauty itself compete</p>
<p>Against gold and pearls and glittering gems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> So again there came my lord’s imperious speech:</p>
<p>‘When you’ve examined all of it in due order,</p>
<p>Take as many tripods as you think you’ll need, <span class="line-number">8570</span></p>
<p>And as many vessels as sacrifice requires,</p>
<p>To fulfil the customs of the sacred rites.</p>
<p>Take cauldrons, and basins, and circular bowls:</p>
<p>The purest of water from the holy fountains,</p>
<p>In deep urns: take care that you’ve dry wood too, <span class="line-number">8575</span></p>
<p>Such as will quickly catch fire, and hold all ready:</p>
<p>And finally don’t forget a well-honed knife:</p>
<p>Everything else I’ll leave for your decision.’</p>
<p>So he spoke, at the same time urging my going:</p>
<p>But he who commanded marked out nothing living <span class="line-number">8580</span></p>
<p>To be slain: to honour the Olympian gods.</p>
<p>Essential, but I’ll think no more about it,</p>
<p>And leave all things in the hands of the gods:</p>
<p>They fulfil whatever is in their mind to do,</p>
<p>Whether or not we think it good or evil: <span class="line-number">8585</span></p>
<p>In either case we mortals must endure it.</p>
<p>Often the priest’s heavy axe has been lifted,</p>
<p>From the bowed neck of the sacrificial victim,</p>
<p>So he could not slaughter it, being hindered,</p>
<p>By enemies near, or the gods’ intervention. <span class="line-number">8590</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> What might happen, think not of that:</p>
<p>Queen, go on, now, step inside,</p>
<p>And be brave!</p>
<p>Good and evil come</p>
<p>Unannounced, to Mankind: <span class="line-number">8595</span></p>
<p>Though it’s proclaimed, we’ll not believe.</p>
<p>Troy still burned: did we not see</p>
<p>Death in our faces, shameful death:</p>
<p>And are we not here,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Let it be, as it will! Whatever awaits me,</p>

<p>That’s before my eyes once more: I know not how.</p>
<p>My feet don’t carry me onwards so bravely, now,</p>

<p>Pine away, arms still outstretched,</p>
<p>To the walls of their prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a god snatched her up, then,</p>
<p>The far-exiled:</p>
<p>And from Ilium’s fall, <span class="line-number">8630</span></p>
<p>Carried her back once more, home</p>

<p>From unspeakable</p>
<p>Rapture and torment, <span class="line-number">8635</span></p>

<p>To cause you such trembling? You can hide nothing,</p>
<p>Since I see your reluctance written on your brow, <span class="line-number">8645</span></p>
<p>And amazement competes there with noble anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> (<em>Who has left the doors open, in her turmoil</em>.)</p>
<p>A daughter of Zeus is stirred by no common fear,</p>
<p>No lightly passing hand of Terror can touch her:</p>
<p>Only the Horror that the womb of ancient Night,</p>
<p>Raised from chaos, and shaped in its many forms, <span class="line-number">8650</span></p>
<p>In glowing clouds that shoot, upwards and outwards,</p>
<p>From the peak’s fiery throat, to shake the hero’s breast.</p>
<p>So here today the Stygian gods have marked</p>
<p>The entrance to my house with terror: and gladly</p>
<p>I’d take myself far away, like a guest let go, <span class="line-number">8655</span></p>
<p>Far from this often trodden, long yearned for threshold.</p>
<p>But no! I’ve retreated here now, into the light,</p>
<p>And you Powers will drive me no further, whoever</p>
<p>You are. Rather, I’ll think of some consecration,</p>
<p>So the hearth-fire, cleansed, greets the wife, as the lord. <span class="line-number">8660</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Leader of the Chorus</span> Noble lady, reveal to your maidservants here,</p>
<p>Who help you reverently, what has happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> You’ll see what I saw yourselves, with your own eyes,</p>
<p>If ancient Night has not, straight away, swallowed it,</p>
<p>That shape of hers: withdrawn it to her heart’s depths. <span class="line-number">8665</span></p>
<p>But I’ll picture it to you in words, so you’ll know:</p>
<p>As, with those recent orders in mind, I trod,</p>
<p>Gravely, through the palace’s innermost room,</p>
<p>Awed by the silence of the gloomy corridors,</p>
<p>No sound of busy labour greeting my ears, <span class="line-number">8670</span></p>
<p>No sound of prompt, diligent effort meeting my eye,</p>
<p>No Stewardess appeared, and no maidservants,</p>
<p>No courtesy such as usually greets the stranger.</p>
<p>But as I approached closer to the hearth stone</p>
<p>Beside the glowing ashes that remained, I saw <span class="line-number">8675</span></p>
<p>A veiled woman, vast shape, seated on the floor,</p>
<p>Not like one who’s asleep, but one deep in thought.</p>
<p>I summoned her to work, with words of command,</p>
<p>Thinking she was the Stewardess whom my husband,</p>
<p>Had placed there perhaps, with foresight, when he left. <span class="line-number">8680</span></p>
<p>But she still sat there, crouched and immoveable:</p>
<p>At last, stirred by my threats, she raised her arm,</p>
<p>As if she gestured me away from hearth and hall.</p>
<p>I turned aside from her, angrily, and sped,</p>
<p>To the steps where the Thalamos is adorned <span class="line-number">8685</span></p>
<p>On high, and close beside it the treasure house:</p>
<p>Suddenly that strange shape sprang up from the floor,</p>
<p>Barring my way, imperiously, showing herself,</p>
<p>Tall and haggard, with hollow, blood-coloured gaze:</p>
<p>A shape so weird that mind and eye were troubled. <span class="line-number">8690</span></p>
<p>But I talk to the wind: for words weary themselves</p>
<p>Trying to conjure forms, vainly, like some creator.</p>
<p>See for yourselves! She even dares the daylight!</p>
<p>Here am I mistress, till the King, my lord, shall come.</p>
<p>Phoebus, beauty’s friend, drives the horrid spawn of Night <span class="line-number">8695</span></p>
<p>To caverns underground, or he binds them fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Phorkyas appears on the threshold, between the doorposts</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Much have I learned, although the locks</p>
<p>Curl youthfully still across my temples!</p>
<p>Many the terrible things I’ve seen,</p>
<p>The soldiers’ misery, Ilium’s night, <span class="line-number">8700</span></p>
<p>When it fell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the clouded, and dust-filled turmoil,</p>
<p>The press of warriors, I heard the gods</p>
<p>Calling terribly, heard the ringing</p>
<p>Iron voice of Discord through the field, <span class="line-number">8705</span></p>
<p>City-wards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah! They still stood there, Ilium’s</p>
<p>Walls, but the glow of the flames</p>
<p>Soon ran from neighbour to neighbour,</p>
<p>Ever spreading, hither and thither, <span class="line-number">8710</span></p>
<p>With the breath of their storm,</p>
<p>Over the darkening city.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleeing, through smoke and heat, I saw</p>
<p>Amid the tongues of soaring fire,</p>
<p>The fearful angry presence of gods, <span class="line-number">8715</span></p>
<p>Marvellous, those striding figures,</p>
<p>Like giants, they were, through the gloom,</p>
<p>The fire-illumined vapour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I see that Confusion,</p>
<p>Or did the fear-consumed Spirit <span class="line-number">8720</span></p>
<p>Create it? Never will I be able,</p>
<p>To say, but I’m truly certain</p>
<p>Of this, that here I see, Her,</p>
<p>Monstrous shape to my eyes:</p>
<p>My hand could even touch Her, <span class="line-number">8725</span></p>
<p>If terror did not restrain me,</p>
<p>Saving me from danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the daughters</p>
<p>Of Phorkyas are you?</p>
<p>Since I liken you <span class="line-number">8730</span></p>
<p>To that family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you perhaps one of the Graeae,</p>
<p>A single eye and a single tooth,</p>
<p>Owned alternately between you,</p>
<p>One born of greyness? <span class="line-number">8735</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monster, do you dare</p>
<p>Here, next to Beauty,</p>
<p>Show yourself to Phoebus,</p>
<p>And his knowing gaze?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then step out before him regardless: <span class="line-number">8740</span></p>
<p>Since he’ll not look at what’s ugly,</p>
<p>Just as his holy eye,</p>
<p>Has never seen shadow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet we mortals are compelled, ah,</p>
<p>By unfortunate gloomy fate, <span class="line-number">8745</span></p>
<p>To the unspeakably painful sight</p>
<p>She, reprehensible, ever ill fated,</p>
<p>Provokes in the lover of Beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet hear me then, if you boldly</p>
<p>Encounter us: hear the curse, <span class="line-number">8750</span></p>
<p>Hear the threat of every abuse,</p>
<p>From the condemnatory mouth of the fortunate,</p>
<p>Whom the gods themselves have created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> (<em>The transformed Mephistopheles</em>.)</p>
<p>The saying is old, with meaning noble and true,</p>
<p>That Beauty and Shame, together, hand in hand, <span class="line-number">8755</span></p>
<p>Never pursue the same path, over green Earth.</p>
<p>Such ancient, deep-rooted hatred lives in both,</p>
<p>That whenever they meet, by chance, on the way,</p>
<p>The one will always turn her back on her rival.</p>
<p>Then quickly and fiercely each goes on, again, <span class="line-number">8760</span></p>
<p>Shame downcast, but Beauty mocking in spirit,</p>
<p>Till in the end Orcus’ dark void shall take her,</p>
<p>If age hasn’t, long before then, tamed her pride.</p>
<p>So now I find you, impudent, come from abroad,</p>
<p>With overflowing arrogance, like the cranes, <span class="line-number">8765</span></p>
<p>Their noisily croaking ranks, high overhead,</p>
<p>Their long cloud, sending its creaking tones, down here,</p>
<p>Tempting the quiet traveller to look upwards:</p>
<p>Yet they pursue their way, while he follows his:</p>
<p>And that’s the way it will be with us as well. <span class="line-number">8770</span></p>
<p>What then are you, wild Maenads or Bacchantes,</p>
<p>That dare to rage round the great royal palace?</p>
<p>Who are you, then, who howl at this high house’s</p>
<p>Stewardess, like a pack of bitches, at the moon?</p>
<p>Do you think it’s hidden from me what race you are? <span class="line-number">8775</span></p>
<p>You brood, begotten in battle, raised on slaughter,</p>
<p>Lusting for men, the seducers and the seduced,</p>
<p>Draining the soldiers’ and the citizens’ powers!</p>
<p>To see your crowd’s like watching a vast swarm</p>
<p>Of locusts settle here, darkening the fields. <span class="line-number">8780</span></p>
<p>You the wasters of others labour! Nibbling,</p>
<p>Destroying, the ripening crops of prosperity!</p>
<p>Defeated, bartered, sold in the market, you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Who abuses the servants before the mistress,</p>
<p>Presumptuously usurping a wife’s true rights? <span class="line-number">8785</span></p>
<p>Only to her is it given to praise whatever’s</p>
<p>Praiseworthy: and to punish what is at fault.</p>
<p>I’m well content, as well, with all the services</p>
<p>They provided to me, when Ilium’s great might,</p>
<p>Stood beleaguered, and fell in ruins: none the less <span class="line-number">8790</span></p>
<p>Just as we’ve endured the wretched wandering</p>
<p>Journey, where often one thinks only of oneself,</p>
<p>So here I expect it now from a happier crew:</p>
<p>A lord asks how slaves serve, not what they are.</p>
<p>So be silent, then, and no longer jeer at them. <span class="line-number">8795</span></p>
<p>If you’ve guarded the king’s house well until now,</p>
<p>In place of the mistress, such is to your credit:</p>
<p>But now that she comes herself, you should draw back,</p>
<p>Lest you find punishment instead of fair reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Disciplining servants is a prerogative <span class="line-number">8800</span></p>
<p>That the noble wife of a king, loved by the gods,</p>
<p>Has duly earned by years of wise discretion.</p>
<p>Since you, acknowledged, take up your former place</p>
<p>Once more, as Queen, and mistress of the house,</p>
<p>Resume the slackened reins again, and rule here, <span class="line-number">8805</span></p>
<p>Hold the treasure in your keeping, and us with it.</p>
<p>But first of all defend me, who am the elder,</p>
<p>Against this crowd, who if they are compared</p>
<p>To your swanlike beauty, are only cackling geese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Leader of the Chorus</span> How ugly ugliness looks, next to beauty. <span class="line-number">8810</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> How stupid the lack of reason, next to sense.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Go down to Orcus, look for <em>your</em> tribe down there! <span class="line-number">8815</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> I intervene, not in anger but in sorrow,</p>
<p>To forbid this alternating discord!</p>
<p>A ruler meets with nothing that’s more harmful</p>
<p>Than private disputes of his quarrelling servants.</p>
<p>Then his firm orders are no longer answered <span class="line-number">8830</span></p>
<p>With swiftly answering and harmonious action,</p>
<p>Instead, wilful commotion roars around him:</p>
<p>Self-composure lost, he abuses them in vain.</p>
<p>Not only that. Unacceptably, in anger,</p>
<p>You’ve summoned the wretched shapes of dreadful forms, <span class="line-number">8835</span></p>
<p>They surround me, so I feel I’m being whirled</p>
<p>To Orcus, from these familiar paternal fields.</p>
<p>Am I remembering? Did delusion grip me?</p>
<p>Was I all of that? Am I, now? And shall be still,</p>
<p>Symbol of dream and fear, to those who waste cities? <span class="line-number">8840</span></p>
<p>The maidservants shudder, but you, the eldest,</p>
<p>Stand there calmly: speak words of reason to me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> The favour of the gods seems only a dream</p>
<p>To one who recalls the troubles of long ages.</p>
<p>But you, blessed, beyond all aim and measure, <span class="line-number">8845</span></p>
<p>Quickly inflamed to every sort of daring risk,</p>
<p>Only found fires of love, in the realm of life,</p>
<p>Theseus, driven by lust, abducted you, a child,</p>
<p>He strong as Hercules: a man nobly formed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> He carried me off, a slender ten-year old fawn, <span class="line-number">8850</span></p>
<p>And caged me in Aphidnus’ tower in Attica.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> But soon freed, by the hands of Castor and Pollux,</p>
<p>A crowd of suitors, the heroes, swarmed round you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Yet, I freely confess, above all, Patroclus</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> But your father’s will bound you to Menelaus,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> He gave him his daughter, and command of the state.</p>
<p>Hermione came from our married existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> But while he disputed his right to far off Crete, <span class="line-number">8860</span></p>
<p>To you, the lonely, came all too handsome a guest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Why do you recall that semi-widowhood,</p>
<p>And all the terrible ruin it caused around me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> To me, a free-born Cretan, his same journey</p>
<p>Brought captivity and years of slavery. <span class="line-number">8865</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> He ordered you here at once, as Stewardess,</p>
<p>Entrusting the fortress and his treasure to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Which you abandoned, for Ilium’s high city,</p>
<p>And the inexhaustible delights of love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Not delights, be sure! All too bitter a sorrow <span class="line-number">8870</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Yet they say that you appeared in dual form,</p>
<p>Seen in Troy and, at the same time, in Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Don’t confuse my clouded, wandering mind completely.</p>
<p>To this moment, I don’t know which of them I am. <span class="line-number">8875</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Then they say: Achilles became your companion,</p>
<p>Came, burning, from the empty realm of shadows!</p>
<p>He’d loved you before, opposing fate’s command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> As phantom, I bound myself to a phantom.</p>
<p>It was a dream, as the tales themselves tell. <span class="line-number">8880</span></p>
<p>I fade, now, become a phantom to myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>She sinks into the arms of the Chorus</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silence! Silence!</p>
<p>False-seeing one, false-speaking one, you!</p>
<p>Out of the terrible single-toothed</p>
<p>Mouth, what might be breathed, so, <span class="line-number">8885</span></p>
<p>Out of so frightful a throat of horror!</p>
<p>Now the malevolent, seemingly benevolent,</p>
<p>Wolf’s anger under the woolly fleece,</p>
<p>Is more terrible to me than the jaws</p>
<p>Of the three-headed dog. <span class="line-number">8890</span></p>
<p>We stand here anxiously listening:</p>
<p>When? How? Where, will such malice</p>
<p>Break out now</p>
<p>From this predatory monster?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now rather than friendly words, richly laced <span class="line-number">8895</span></p>
<p>With trust, waters of Lethe, sweet and mild,</p>
<p>You stir up all from the past,</p>
<p>The evil more than the good,</p>
<p>And instantly darken</p>
<p>The gleam of the present <span class="line-number">8900</span></p>
<p>And also the future’s</p>
<p>Sweetly glimmering, hopeful dawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silence! Silence!</p>
<p>So the Queen’s spirit, now,</p>
<p>Almost ready to leave her, <span class="line-number">8905</span></p>
<p>Can still hold, and uphold</p>
<p>This, the form of all forms</p>

<p>(<em>Helen has recovered, and stands in the centre again</em>.)</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Shining out from fleeting vapours, comes the sunlight of our day, here,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> I step, trembling, from the abyss that, in fainting, closed around me,</p>

<p>So the sacrifice can kneel in royal manner,</p>
<p>And be wrapped around, once the head is severed, <span class="line-number">8945</span></p>
<p>And buried decently there, and with due honour.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Leader of the Chorus</span> The Queen stands here beside us deep in thought,</p>
<p>The maidservants wither away like mown grass:</p>
<p>I think that I, as the eldest, am bound, in sacred duty,</p>
<p>To barter words with you, the eldest of all by far. <span class="line-number">8950</span></p>
<p>You’re wise, experienced, and seem well-disposed,</p>
<p>And though this foolish crowd baited you in error,</p>
<p>Speak of a way to escape this fate, if you know it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> That’s easily done: it depends on the Queen alone,</p>
<p>To save herself, and you her followers with her. <span class="line-number">8955</span></p>
<p>But decision is required, and of the swiftest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Most honoured of Fates, wisest of Sibyls, you,</p>
<p>Hold the gold shears apart: bring both aid and light:</p>
<p>Already, we feel ourselves swinging, struggling,</p>
<p>Fearful, for our limbs would rather be dancing, <span class="line-number">8960</span></p>
<p>And afterwards rest, soft, on our lovers’ breast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Let them be afraid! I feel pain but no terror:</p>
<p>Yet if rescue’s possible, I gladly accept.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Speak, and tell us, tell us quickly: how we might escape the terror,</p>
<p>Dreadful nooses that still threaten, like some kind of evil necklace</p>
<p>Wound around our tender necks? Already we, oh, wretched creatures,</p>
<p>Feel the choking, suffocating, if you, Rhea, the great mother</p>
<p>Of the gods, won’t show us mercy. <span class="line-number">8970</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Have you the patience to listen, to long winded</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Patience enough! While we’re listening, we’re alive.</p>

<p>But whoever, in guilt, crosses the square-cut stones</p>
<p>Of the sacred threshold, swiftly, with fleeing steps,</p>
<p>Will, indeed find the ancient place, on their return, <span class="line-number">8980</span></p>
<p>But altered in every way, if not overthrown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Why recount these familiar sayings here?</p>
<p>If you’d relate things: don’t provoke annoyance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> It’s simple fact, in no way a criticism.</p>
<p>Menelaus sailed from bay to bay, looting, <span class="line-number">8985</span></p>
<p>Skirted the coast and islands, aggressively,</p>
<p>Returned with the spoils that are rusting there.</p>
<p>Then he spent ten long years there in front of Troy:</p>
<p>And I don’t know how many more, on the way home.</p>
<p>And how are things now with this place where we stand, <span class="line-number">8990</span></p>
<p>Tyndareus’ noble house, and the region round?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Do you embrace all scorn so completely</p>
<p>You can only open your mouth to criticise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> The vales were neglected for so many years,</p>
<p>Those that rise behind Sparta, to the northward, <span class="line-number">8995</span></p>
<p>Beyond Taygetus, from where, a living stream,</p>
<p>Eurotas, pours downward, then along our valley,</p>
<p>Flows by our broad reed-beds, to feed your swans.</p>
<p>Up there, in the mountain vales, a bold race settled,</p>
<p>Pushing southward from Cimmerian darkness, <span class="line-number">9000</span></p>
<p>And then built an inaccessible fortress there,</p>
<p>From which, at will, they harass land and people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Have they achieved all that? It seems unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> They’ve had time, perhaps twenty years in all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helena</span> Is there a leader? Are they a band of robbers? <span class="line-number">9005</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Not robbers, but one of them acts as leader.</p>
<p>I don’t curse him, though he attacked me too.</p>
<p>He might have taken all, but was satisfied</p>
<p>With gifts, not tribute, as he called them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> How did he look?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Less than evil! He pleased me well. <span class="line-number">9010</span></p>
<p>He’s vigorous, daring, and sophisticated,</p>
<p>An intelligent man: as few among the Greeks.</p>
<p>They call his race Barbarians, but I’m doubtful</p>
<p>If they are any crueller than those heroes</p>
<p>Who proved such devourers of men, before Troy. <span class="line-number">9015</span></p>
<p>I respected his greatness, and confided in him.</p>
<p>His fortress! You should see with your own eyes!</p>
<p>It’s a great deal more than the clumsy masonry</p>
<p>Your father rolled together, higgledy-piggledy,</p>
<p>Cyclopean as a Cyclops, piling raw stone, <span class="line-number">9020</span></p>
<p>Over raw stone: there, instead there, it’s all</p>
<p>Plumb line and balance: it’s laid out by rule.</p>
<p>Look from outside! It rises straight to the sky,</p>
<p>So firm, tightly jointed – smooth as a steel mirror</p>
<p>To climb – that even your thoughts slide off! <span class="line-number">9025</span></p>
<p>And, inside, great courts with plenty of room,</p>
<p>Ringed by buildings, of every use and nature.</p>
<p>There you’ll see pillars, columns, arches, quoins,</p>
<p>Balconies, galleries, facing inwards and outwards,</p>
<p>And coats of arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> What arms are those?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas </span> Ajax carried <span class="line-number">9030</span></p>
<p>A writhing snake on his shield: you yourself saw it.</p>
<p>The Seven against Thebes also bore their symbols</p>
<p>On each of their shields, replete with meaning.</p>
<p>There you saw moons, and stars in the night sky,</p>
<p>Heroes and Goddesses, torches, ladders, swords, <span class="line-number">9035</span></p>
<p>And whatever fierce weapons threaten fine cities.</p>
<p>Our heroic band carries such images too,</p>
<p>In bright colours, bestowed by our ancestors.</p>
<p>There you see lions, eagles with beaks and claws,</p>
<p>Horns of oxen, wings, roses, and peacocks’ tails, <span class="line-number">9040</span></p>
<p>Bands too made of gold, black, silver, blue and red.</p>
<p>The like of these hang in their halls, row on row.</p>
<p>In spacious halls, as wide as the whole wide world:</p>
<p>You could dance there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Chorus</span> Say then, are there dancers, there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> The best! A lively crowd of golden-haired youths. <span class="line-number">9045</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> What? Do I fear King Menelaus would commit</p>
<p>Such a cruel offence as to make me kill myself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Have you forgotten how he wreaked mutilation,</p>
<p>Unheard-of, on Deiphobus, dead Paris’ brother, <span class="line-number">9055</span></p>
<p>Because he stubbornly claimed you, the widow,</p>
<p>And prized you? He cropped both nose and ears,</p>
<p>And disfigured him, there: It was terrible to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Helen</span> Yes he did that, and he did it for my sake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Phorkyas</span> Because of it, now, he’ll do the same to you. <span class="line-number">9060</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Trumpets sound in the distance: the Chorus starts in terror</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a trumpet call pierces the ear to grip</p>
<p>And tear the innards: Jealousy drives her claws</p>
<p>Into the breast of him who can never forget <span class="line-number">9065</span></p>
<p>What once he had, and lost, and no longer has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Proclaiming death, they are speaking.</p>
<p>Ah, that to us they may not,</p>

<p>Can’t you see? Isn’t that Hermes</p>
<p>Soaring ahead? Doesn’t his gold wand gleam,</p>
<p>Beckoning us, ordering us back again</p>
<p>To the wholly joyless, and greyly-twilit,</p>

<p>Overcrowded, ever-empty Hades?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, at once, now, all is darkening, dully all the vapours vanish,</p>
<p>Grey with gloom, and brown as walls. Walls appearing to our vision,</p>
<p>Blank now to our clearer vision. A court now is it? Or a deep pit?</p>
<p>Fearful, though, in either case, now! Sisters, oh! We are imprisoned, <span class="line-number">9125</span></p>
<p>Captives, as we’ve never been.</p>

<p>And all that I have vainly imagined mine?</p>
<p>Freely and loyally, before your feet, <span class="line-number">9270</span></p>

<p>From the Eastwards we pressed on,</p>
<p>And suddenly the West were gone.</p>
<p>So wide and long the people massed,</p>
<p>The first knew nothing of the last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first rank fell: the next stood fast, <span class="line-number">9285</span></p>
<p>The third ranks’ lances unsurpassed:</p>
<p>Each man was like a hundredfold,</p>
<p>Thousands died there, all untold.</p>

<p>We pressed forwards: we stormed on,</p>
<p>We were masters, then were gone: <span class="line-number">9290</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow robbed, and stole away.</p>

<p>We looked – and rapid was that look:</p>
<p>The loveliest women there we took,</p>
<p>We took the oxen from the stall, <span class="line-number">9295</span></p>
<p>We took the horses, took them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my delight was to discover</p>
<p>The rarest things I could uncover:</p>
<p>And what other men might grasp,</p>

<p>Every chest was glass to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heaps of gold, they were mine, <span class="line-number">9305</span></p>
<p>And the noblest gems I’d find:</p>
<p>Yet now the emeralds alone</p>
<p>Are worthy to adorn your throne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sway there now ‘twixt ear and lip,</p>
<p>You pearly spheres from oceans deep: <span class="line-number">9310</span></p>
<p>A place the rubies dare not seek,</p>
<p>So pale beside your rosy cheek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so the riches, every prize,</p>
<p>I set down here before your eyes:</p>
<p>Before your feet I gladly yield, <span class="line-number">9315</span></p>

<p>Let me follow your path still</p>
<p>And your treasure chambers fill. <span class="line-number">9320</span></p>

<p>You’d scarcely mounted to the throne,</p>
<p>When all bowed down, to you alone,</p>
<p>Wisdom, riches, worldly power,</p>
<p>Before your grace, that very hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I held it all fast: that is true <span class="line-number">9325</span></p>
<p>But now it’s loosed, and all for you.</p>
<p>I thought its worth was plain to see,</p>
<p>But now it’s nothing much, to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I’ve owned will pass</p>
<p>From me like mown and withered grass. <span class="line-number">9330</span></p>

<p>And like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’</p>
<p>So he leaps the rocky masses of the cavern, from a cornice,</p>
<p>To another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown.</p>
<p>But suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern,</p>
<p>And it seems he’s lost. His mother grieves for him, father comforts, <span class="line-number">9615</span></p>
<p>I stand there, wondering anxiously, but there again’s the vision!</p>
<p>Do buried treasures lie there? Robes embroidered all with flowers,</p>
<p>He has fittingly assumed.</p>
<p>Tassels tremble from his shoulders, ribbons flutter round his chest,</p>
<p>In his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo, <span class="line-number">9620</span></p>
<p>He steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing.</p>
<p>And the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts,</p>
<p>What’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming,</p>
<p>Is it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power?</p>
<p>So he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already <span class="line-number">9625</span></p>
<p>The future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal</p>
<p>Melodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him,</p>

<p>Slipping, with quick unfolding wings,</p>
<p>Boldly into the sunlit air, <span class="line-number">9660</span></p>

<p>Slyly, his sword from its scabbard: <span class="line-number">9670</span></p>
<p>Bow and arrows from Phoebus too,</p>
<p>And tongs from Hephaestus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He even stole Father Zeus’</p>
<p>Lightning bolts, not scared of fire:</p>
<p>Then he tripped poor Eros up, <span class="line-number">9675</span></p>

<p>The flame itself has gone, that’s understood,</p>

<p>Here’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">A Third Section of the Chorus</span> Sisters! We, of nimbler senses, hurry onwards with the waters: <span class="line-number">10005</span></p>

<p>There, each day, we’ll pay attention to the cultivator’s passion,</p>
<p>Watch his diligence and care, there: watch for its uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>How he hoes, how he digs there, how he heaps, and prunes, and ties, <span class="line-number">10015</span></p>
<p>Prays to all the gods above him, most of all prays to the sun god.</p>
<p>The effeminate one, Bacchus, gives scant thought to faithful servants,</p>
<p>Rests in arbours, lolls in caverns, flirting with the youngest Faun.</p>
<p>Whatsoever he might need there, for his half-befuddled dreaming,</p>
<p>Is left for him in wineskins, stored around in jars and vessels, <span class="line-number">10020</span></p>
<p>Right and left, in cool recesses, gathered through the endless ages.</p>
<p>But when the gods, that’s Helios, we mean before all others,</p>
<p>Cooling, wetting, warming, heating, fill the vineyard’s horn of plenty,</p>
<p>Where the silent grower laboured, suddenly it’s all enlivened,</p>
<p>And in every leaf there’s rustling, rustling now from vine to vine. <span class="line-number">10025</span></p>
<p>Baskets creaking, buckets rattling, the tubs are carried groaning,</p>
<p>All towards enormous vats there, to the lusty treaders’ dance:</p>
<p>So, then, all the sacred bounty, of the pure bred juicy harvest,</p>
<p>Fiercely trodden, spurting, foaming, mingled there, is crudely squashed.</p>
<p>Now the cymbals’ brazen clamour’s ringing boldly in our ears, <span class="line-number">10030</span></p>
<p>As Dionysus from his Mysteries is unveiled, and is revealed:</p>
<p>Here with his goat-foot Satyrs, whirling goat-foot Satyresses,</p>
<p>And Silenus’s, unruly, long-eared ass, that brays amongst them.</p>
<p>Nothing’s spared! The cloven feet now, trample on all decency:</p>
<p>All the senses whirl, bewildered: hideously, ears are stunned, there. <span class="line-number">10035</span></p>
<p>Drunkards fumble for their wine-cups, head and bellies over-full,</p>
<p>Here and there one has misgivings, but can only swell the riot,</p>

<p>Leaving the cloud-vehicle that carried me,</p>
<p>Softly, through bright day, over land and ocean.</p>
<p>Slowly, not dispersing, now, it moves away.</p>
<p>With a rolling movement, travelling eastward,</p>
<p>And the eye follows in wondering admiration. <span class="line-number">10045</span></p>
<p>Moving it divides, wave-like and changeable.</p>
<p>Yet it shapes itself – My eyes can’t deceive me! –</p>
<p>I see, reclining there, nobly, on sunlit pillows,</p>
<p>A godlike female form, though it’s immense!</p>
<p>An image of Juno, Leda, or Helen herself, <span class="line-number">10050</span></p>
<p>Royally lovely, floating before my eyes.</p>
<p>Ah! It’s already melting! Formlessly huge</p>

<p>Reflecting deep meaning from fine fleeting days.</p>
<p>Yet a soft, delicate band of mist still clings <span class="line-number">10055</span></p>
<p>To head and body, coolly caressing: and cheers me.</p>
<p>Now it lifts lightly, soars higher and higher, there,</p>
<p>Condensing. Does its enticing shape deceive me,</p>
<p>Like some long-forgotten joy of earliest youth?</p>
<p>The first riches of the heart’s depths flow again: <span class="line-number">10060</span></p>
<p>I’d liken it to Aurora’s Love, light-winged:</p>
<p>The first, swiftly felt, scarcely understood glance,</p>
<p>That outshines every treasure when it’s held fast.</p>
<p>The lovely form rises, now, like spiritual beauty,</p>
<p>Not melting further, but lifting through the air, <span class="line-number">10065</span></p>
<p>And carries, far-off, the best of what I am.</p>

<p>Banished us from the air to deepest deeps,</p>
<p>There, where round and round the glow of Hell,</p>
<p>An eternal inward self-fuelled fire leaps,</p>
<p>We found we were too brightly illuminated,</p>
<p>Quite crowded, and uncomfortably situated. <span class="line-number">10080</span></p>
<p>All the devils fell to fits of coughing,</p>
<p>The vents above them and beneath them puffing,</p>
<p>Hell swollen with the sulphur’s stench and acid,</p>
<p>Gave out its gas! The bubble was so massive,</p>
<p>That soon the level surface of the earth, <span class="line-number">10085</span></p>
<p>Thick as it was, was forced to crack and burst.</p>
<p>So we all gained another mountain from it,</p>
<p>And what was ground, before, now is summit.</p>
<p>From this they deduced the truest law,</p>
<p>Turn lowest into highest, to be sure, <span class="line-number">10090</span></p>
<p>Since we escaped from fiery prison there,</p>
<p>To excessive power in the freer air:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> To me the mountain masses are nobly dumb, <span class="line-number">10095</span></p>

<p>The ball of Earth she neatly rounded,</p>
<p>Delighting in the mountains and the deep,</p>
<p>Setting rock on rock, and peak on peak, <span class="line-number">10100</span></p>
<p>Sloping the hills conveniently downward,</p>
<p>Softening them to vales, gently bounded.</p>
<p>They grow green, and joyfully she ranges,</p>
<p>Without the need for any violent changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Yes, so you say! It’s clear as day to you: <span class="line-number">10105</span></p>

<p>Enduring all that swollen, fiery tide:</p>
<p>When Moloch’s hammer forged cliffs, at a blow,</p>
<p>And flung the ruined mountains, far and wide. <span class="line-number">10110</span></p>
<p>Those foreign boulders scattered through the land:</p>
<p>Who knows what forces left them high and dry?</p>
<p>Philosophers all have failed to understand,</p>
<p>The rocks are there, and we must let them stand,</p>
<p>We’ve damaged them, already, where they lie. <span class="line-number">10115</span></p>
<p>Only the true believers, the people, know,</p>

<p>On the riches of the world, and its splendid sights. (<em>Matthew 4</em>)</p>
<p>Yet, hard as you may be to fire,</p>
<p>Didn’t you feel some deep desire?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> I did! I saw a mighty plan.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Oh, that’s easily done. <span class="line-number">10135</span></p>
<p>I’d find myself some capital city,</p>
<p>It’s core the citizens’ greedy plenty,</p>
<p>Crooked alleys and pointed gables,</p>
<p>Cabbage, turnips, onions, market tables:</p>
<p>Butcher’s stalls where flies all cluster: <span class="line-number">10140</span></p>
<p>Round the fattened joints, pass muster:</p>
<p>Wherever you move, there you’ll find</p>
<p>Stench and activity, intertwined.</p>
<p>Then wide streets, and wider squares,</p>
<p>Measured, elegant thoroughfares: <span class="line-number">10145</span></p>
<p>And, at their end, no gates to bar you:</p>
<p>Just boundless far-flung suburbs too.</p>
<p>There I love to see all the carriages go by,</p>
<p>The noisy rushing about from side to side,</p>
<p>The endless running to and fro, <span class="line-number">10150</span></p>
<p>Of scattered ants in ceaseless flow.</p>
<p>And when I walk, and when I ride,</p>
<p>I’d be the central point implied,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand honouring me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> That could never content me though. <span class="line-number">10155</span></p>

<p>Between green walls of velvet leaves,</p>
<p>Straight walks, where artful shadows please, <span class="line-number">10165</span></p>
<p>Waterfalls, spanning the rocks, in pairs,</p>
<p>And all those kinds of water-jet affairs:</p>
<p>Rising nobly, while all round the dish,</p>
<p>A thousand little fountains hiss and piss.</p>
<p>Then I’d have a hut, snug and convenient, <span class="line-number">10170</span></p>
<p>Where beautiful women might be content:</p>
<p>And pass the boundless time away</p>
<p>In the sweetest solitude, and play.</p>
<p>Women, I say: since, one and all,</p>

<p>Storming towards the wide shore’s level shelf.</p>
<p>And that annoyed me: as the exuberance</p>
<p>Of a free spirit, that values all its rights,</p>
<p>Will transmit uneasy feelings to the dance</p>
<p>Of the passionate blood that it excites. <span class="line-number">10205</span></p>
<p>I thought it chance: I gazed more intensely:</p>
<p>The waves paused, rolled away from me,</p>

<p>There wave rules power-inspired wave, again</p>
<p>Draws back – and yet still there’s nothing gained.</p>
<p>If anything makes me despair, of my intent,</p>
<p>It’s the aimless force of that wild element!</p>
<p>Then my spirit dared to soar high above: <span class="line-number">10220</span></p>
<p>Here I must fight, and this I must remove.</p>
<p>And it’s possible! – However tides may flow,</p>
<p>At last they nestle round the hills below:</p>
<p>So they are tamed in their exuberance,</p>
<p>A modest height tops their proud advance, <span class="line-number">10225</span></p>
<p>A modest depth draws them forcefully on.</p>
<p>Quick, through my mind, leapt plan after plan:</p>

<p>What he whispers then in some faithful ear,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Don’t you know the bands of mist</p>
<p>That drift round the Sicilian cliffs? <span class="line-number">10585</span></p>
<p>There, in the daylight, clear,</p>

<p>Mirrored in peculiar cloud,</p>
<p>Marvellous images appear.</p>
<p>Cities wander to and fro, <span class="line-number">10590</span></p>
<p>Gardens rise above, below,</p>
<p>As form on form fills the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> Yet it’s suspicious! All about</p>

<p>It looks quite ghostly there, to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Forgive me, Lord, those are the traces</p>

<p>They show their last strength there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> But tell me: who then might command</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Who else than that noble Master,</p>

<p>The thought of military disaster</p>
<p>Moves him deeply, stirs his art.</p>
<p>In gratitude, he wants to save you, <span class="line-number">10610</span></p>
<p>Though he himself should suffer too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> They cheered me, when I was invested:</p>
<p>So I was keen to see my power tested:</p>
<p>I found it useful, without much thought, as ruler,</p>
<p>To send that wise man where the air was cooler. <span class="line-number">10615</span></p>
<p>I robbed the clergy of a fond desire,</p>
<p>And hardly won their favour from the fire.</p>
<p>Now that so many years have gone</p>
<p>Is this the reward of what I’d done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Good deeds from the heart reap riches: <span class="line-number">10620</span></p>
<p>Let your glance stray upwards now!</p>
<p>I think he’ll send a sign, a show,</p>
<p>Attend: straight away it’s as he wishes.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor </span> An eagle soars in the upper air,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Attend: It’s an auspicious feature.</p>
<p>The Gryphon’s a fabulous creature:</p>
<p>How could he forget who’s regal,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> And now, they fly in wider gyres, <span class="line-number">10630</span></p>
<p>They wheel together: swiftly now</p>
<p>Then dash against each other’s bow,</p>
<p>So neck and chest are ripped entire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Now note the miserable Gryphon,</p>

<p>Now, with his lion’s tail all torn,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> As it’s prophesied, so let it be!</p>

<p>Drifts away towards the right,</p>
<p>So defusing all the force</p>
<p>Of their army’s sinister course. <span class="line-number">10645</span></p>
<p>Our phalanx with its spears tightening</p>
<p>Moves to the right, and like lightening</p>
<p>Strikes them in the weakest place:</p>
<p>Now like the storm-driven waves</p>
<p>They roar, with opposing force, <span class="line-number">10650</span></p>
<p>Wildly on their dual course:</p>
<p>Gloriously all sound dies away,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> (<em>On the left, to Faust</em>.)</p>
<p>See! Something looks suspicious,</p>

<p>Not a stone’s hurled in the air,</p>
<p>The cliffs below are taken there,</p>
<p>Bare the narrows, to the pass.</p>
<p>Now! The enemy <em>en masse</em></p>
<p>Are ever nearer to the sun, <span class="line-number">10660</span></p>
<p>Perhaps we’re already overrun:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> See, my two ravens come winging,</p>

<p>I fear we’re in trouble here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> What do they mean these wretched birds?</p>

<p>Here’s a slightly different kind:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> The birds announce a dreadful fate:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> So I’m betrayed at last! <span class="line-number">10685</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> Keep it for another day, one better</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll not grant the baton to you,</p>

<p>(<em>He exits into his tent with the Commander-In-Chief</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> Let that blunt stick protect the man!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> What can we do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> It’s already done! <span class="line-number">10710</span></p>
<p>Now dark Cousins, hurry from the scene,</p>

<p>And beg from them their gleaming flood.</p>
<p>Their female arts, those difficult of knowing,</p>
<p>Can divorce appearances from being, <span class="line-number">10715</span></p>
<p>And all still swear it’s being that they’re seeing.</p>

<p>(<em>Pause</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> With flattery our pair of ravens</p>
<p>Have so charmed those water maidens</p>
<p>That trickling flows at once begin.</p>
<p>And many a bald, dry ridge of mountain <span class="line-number">10720</span></p>
<p>Becomes a swollen, rushing fountain:</p>
<p>The enemy can no longer win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> It’s not a greeting to which they’re used.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> Now, powerfully, streams pour on streams, <span class="line-number">10725</span></p>
<p>Sweeping from gorges with redoubled gleams,</p>
<p>A river now throws up an arching veil:</p>
<p>Pours over the rocky level in a tide,</p>
<p>Runs foaming down, on every side,</p>
<p>And, stepwise, hurls itself into the dale. <span class="line-number">10730</span></p>
<p>What use their fine, heroic resistance?</p>
<p>The vast wave roars, and fills the distance.</p>
<p>I shudder myself at this wild waterfall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> I can see nothing of these watery lies,</p>

<p>In companies, their men plunge down,</p>

<p>With swimming strokes, they run around. <span class="line-number">10740</span></p>

<p>I’ll praise you to the noble Master: but see,</p>

<p>Hurry to the glowing smithy,</p>
<p>Where the dwarf folk never weary, <span class="line-number">10745</span></p>
<p>Hammering sparks from steel and stone.</p>
<p>Ask for, once you’ve chattered first,</p>
<p>A fire to shine: sparkle, and burst,</p>
<p>The finest that man’s ever known.</p>
<p>It’s true that far off lightning flashes, <span class="line-number">10750</span></p>
<p>And stars that fall in sudden dashes,</p>
<p>Can happen any summer’s night:</p>
<p>But lightning in the tangled bushes,</p>
<p>And stars that fizzle in the rushes,</p>
<p>They’re not such a common sight. <span class="line-number">10755</span></p>
<p>Don’t trouble about my command,</p>
<p>Ask first, then afterwards demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>The Ravens fly off. All takes place as ordered</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Darkness cloaks the enemy!</p>
<p>Their footsteps meet uncertainty!</p>
<p>Everywhere are wandering flares, <span class="line-number">10760</span></p>
<p>And those sudden blinding glares!</p>
<p>It’s all beautiful indeed,</p>
<p>Now some noise is what we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Faust</span> The empty armour from each vaulted room,</p>

<p>A marvellous, and deceptive sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">Mephistopheles</span> That’s it! They no longer feel constrained:</p>

<p>Breastplates and helmets gleam,</p>
<p>As Guelph and Ghibelline,</p>
<p>They quickly renew eternal strife.</p>
<p>Locked in hereditary bile,</p>
<p>They prove themselves, un-reconciled: <span class="line-number">10775</span></p>
<p>Far and wide the noise is rife.</p>
<p>In the end, by all the Devils, yes!</p>
<p>Partisan hatred’s still the best,</p>
<p>Till final ruin ends the tale:</p>
<p>Here rise the sounds of utter panic, <span class="line-number">10780</span></p>
<p>And others bitter and Satanic,</p>

<p>High-Cupbearer, take care those cellars of mine</p>

<p>And load the imperial table with all that’s best,</p>
<p>With every kind of vessel, in silver and gold,</p>
<p>But the handsomest of all for you I’ll hold: <span class="line-number">10920</span></p>
<p>A clear Venetian glass, where joy is waiting,</p>
<p>That strengthens the taste, without intoxicating.</p>
<p>One often trusts too much in such a treasure:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> What I bestow on you at this grave moment, <span class="line-number">10925</span></p>
<p>You hear, in confidence, has my true intent.</p>
<p>The Emperor’s word is great, his gift is sure,</p>
<p>But to be enacted it needs his signature,</p>
<p>His noble mark. Here’s the right man I see</p>
<p>True to his time, to complete the formality. <span class="line-number">10930</span></p>

<p>If the arch can trust the keystone’s part,</p>
<p>Then it’s raised securely, with lasting art.</p>
<p>You see four Princes here! And I’ve explained</p>
<p>How my House and Court must be sustained.</p>
<p>Now, what the empire holds within its bounds <span class="line-number">10935</span></p>
<p>Is placed, with weight and power, in your hands.</p>
<p>You’ll outshine all others in your estates:</p>
<p>So I’ve extended your walls and gates,</p>
<p>With the lost possessions of our enemy.</p>
<p>I award you fine lands, for your loyalty. <span class="line-number">10940</span></p>
<p>Together with the right, in due course,</p>
<p>To buy, exchange, or add to them by force:</p>
<p>Then, be it known, I grant you unhindered use –</p>
<p>Of what belongs to you, the landlord’s dues.</p>
<p>When you as judges speak your final thought, <span class="line-number">10945</span></p>
<p>No appeal shall be heard by a higher court.</p>
<p>Then taxes, levies, rents, and tolls and fees,</p>
<p>Are yours: of mines, mints, salt the royalties.</p>
<p>And to display my gratitude completely,</p>
<p>I’ve raised you all to highest majesty. <span class="line-number">10950</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Archbishop</span> On behalf of us all I give our deepest thanks to you!</p>

<p>From present things to those that follow after.</p>
<p>I too, in time, must leave all I still hold dear,</p>
<p>It’s your duty then to name a new ruler, here.</p>
<p>At our holy altar, crown and raise him high:</p>

<p>Your hallowed head still toys with Satan’s power!</p>
<p>True, you’ve secured the throne now, yet it seems,</p>
<p>Sadly, scorning God, and the Pope’s great schemes.</p>
<p>When he learns of it, swift punishment he’ll bring, <span class="line-number">10985</span></p>
<p>And destroy your sinful realm with holy lightning.</p>
<p>He’s not forgotten how, at that earlier time,</p>
<p>Of coronation, you freed the wizard: in crime.</p>
<p>With your diadem, you injured Christianity,</p>
<p>Striking a cursed head with the first act of mercy. <span class="line-number">10990</span></p>
<p>Now beat your breast and from your guilty measure,</p>
<p>Give back to the holy shrine a little treasure:</p>
<p>You, taught humility, devote to pious use, and good,</p>
<p>The spacious stretch of hills where your tent stood.</p>
<p>Where evil spirits gathered for your protection, <span class="line-number">10995</span></p>
<p>And the Prince of Liars secured your attention:</p>
<p>Grant mount and forest deep, as far as they extend,</p>
<p>And heights, the green slopes adorn, without end.</p>
<p>Clear lakes rich in fish, countless streams that flow,</p>
<p>Winding swiftly, that rush to the valleys below: <span class="line-number">11000</span></p>

<p>Show your remorse: gain the mercy that must follow.</p>

<p>Already the sun’s dawn glance lights the choir,</p>
<p>The growing building takes the cross’s structure,</p>
<p>The nave long and high, a delight to each believer: <span class="line-number">11010</span></p>
<p>Already as they press eagerly through the doors,</p>
<p>A first peal rings through hills, down valley floors,</p>
<p>From the high tower, that’s striving towards heaven,</p>
<p>The penitent comes, to whom new life is given.</p>
<p>That day of consecration – may it be soon! – <span class="line-number">11015</span></p>
<p>When your presence grants the greatest boon.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="play-char">The Emperor</span> Let the pious mind proclaim so great an action,</p>

<p>And its careful upkeep will cost us dearly.</p>
<p>From all that plunder, grant us a measure of gold,</p>

<p>Your noble wisdom has been crowned,</p>
<p>Sea’s reconciled with solid ground:</p>

<p>So speak, that here, from your spire, <span class="line-number">11225</span></p>

<p>A masterpiece of the human spirit,</p>

<p>A wider human residence. <span class="line-number">11250</span></p>

<p>Being rich, to feel we lack something.</p>
<p>The bell’s chime, the lindens’ breeze,</p>
<p>Like tombs in churchyards stifle me.</p>
<p>The exercise of my all-conquering will <span class="line-number">11255</span></p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">About the Author</h2>
<p class="no-indent">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1749. In 1774 he published his first major work, the self-revelatory novel <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>, in which he created the prototype of the Romantic hero, and instigated a European fashion. He consequently became a leading figure in the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> movement, which celebrated a Promethean restlessness of spirit as opposed to the rationalism of the Enlightenment. Later, in the service of Duke Karl August at Weimar, Goethe took on a wide variety of social and cultural roles and, with his journey to Italy in 1786-88, turned extensively to Classical art and thought as a means of achieving greater personal balance and perspective. He also developed a range of scientific interests, for example plant biology and the theory of colour. His later literary achievements include the drama of <em>Faust</em>, and a wealth of shorter poems and lyrics embodying his mature philosophy. Goethe died in Weimar in 1832.</p>
