In exchange, Faust will become more beautiful and successful, while Mephistopheles will ensure that Faust's time on earth is filled with joy and pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bargain is sealed when Mephistopheles presents Faust with a ring containing the seven deadly sins, and Faust accepts it. This act symbolizes Faust's surrender of his moral integrity and his willingness to abandon his former life of virtue for material success and earthly pleasures.\n",

      "Throughout the play, Faust's negotiations with Mephistopheles serve as a metaphor for the human desire for knowledge, power, and pleasure. Faust is drawn into a world of illusions and temptations, but he is ultimately unable to resist the allure of the devil's promises.\n",

      "Ultimately, the bargain comes back to haunt Faust, who must confront the consequences of his actions in the afterlife. The play ends with Faust trapped in hell, unable to escape due to Mephistopheles' manipulation and the loss of his soul."

Insistent, she comes pushing in here:\\nSenseless haste is wrong, even where there’s danger.\\nUnlucky news makes the fairest messenger ugly:\\nYou, ugliest of all, bring only bad news gladly.\\nBut you’ll not succeed for once: disturb the air\\nWith your empty breath.

Now you’ll see the heroes gather,\\nThe whole wide land will here unite:\\nHe deserves the ladies’ favour,\\nWho, in their defence, shall fight.\\n(To the leaders, who step forward from the ranks, and advance.)\\n\\nRage silently, and do your duty,\\nThen you’ll achieve the victory,\\nYou, the prime of northern beauty,\\nYou, the flower of the east.\\nCased in steel, with steel gleaming,\\nThe army shatters realms at will,\\nThey appear: the earth is shaking,\\nThey advance, it echoes still.\\nAt Pylos, once, we came to shore,\\nOld Nestor is no longer living,\\nOur independent army saw\\nUs shatter all the mighty kings.\\nFrom these walls, in an instant,\\nSend Menelaus back to sea:\\nThere robbing, killing, is his errand,\\nAs is his wish and destiny.\\nDukes, I greet you every one,\\nCommanded by the Spartan Queen:\\nAt her feet lay vale and mountain,\\nWin the kingdoms in between.\\nGermans, with your walls and towers,\\nDefend Corinth and her bays!\\nThen Achaia’s hundred gorges\\nI’ll trust to you, the Goths, always.\\nLet the Franks advance on Elis,\\nMessene, to the Saxons brave,\\nNormans, hold the Argolis,\\nRule the shore: and rule the wave.\\nWhen everyone has his own land,\\nAt foreign foes, let force be aimed,\\nWhile Sparta holds the high command\\nOur Queen’s ancestral domain.\\nShe’ll behold you each, delighting\\nIn lands, possessed of every right:\\nAnd at her feet you’ll seek her blessing,\\nAcknowledgement, and law and light.\\n(Faust descends from the throne: the Princes form a circle round him to receive individual commands and instructions.)\\n\\n\\nChorus says:\\nWho wants the loveliest for himself,\\nFirst, above everything,\\nWould be wise to have weapons about him:\\nHe might well gain by flattery\\nWhoever is noblest on Earth:\\nBut he won’t possess her in peace:\\nThe sly, and insidious tempt her from him,\\nRobbers will boldly steal her from him:\\nHe must prepare to foil them.\\nSo I praise our Prince the while,\\nAnd think him nobler than the rest,\\nSince he combines wisdom and strength,\\nSo that the powerful show obedience,\\nWaiting his every command.\\nThey follow his orders faithfully,\\nEach as much for his own profit\\nAs for the ruler’s reward and thanks,\\nWinning the highest fame for both.\\nWho now will drag her away\\nFrom the powerful possessor?\\nShe belongs to him: let her be his,\\nDoubly bestowed by us, so she\\nAnd he, are surrounded inside by thick walls,\\nOutside, by the greatest of armies.\\n\\nFaust says:\\nThe gifts that, on those here, I bestow –\\nTo each of them a prosperous land –\\nAre great and glorious, let them go!\\nWe in the middle take our stand.\\nIn their rivalry they’ll protect you\\nHalf-island ringed by leaping waves,\\nWhile these slender hills connect you\\nTo Europe’s last great mountain range.\\nThis land, that outshines every land,\\nBe blessed for every race forever,\\nDelivered to my Queen’s command,\\nThat, long ago now, wondered at her,\\nThere, by Eurotas’ whispering light,\\nShe broke radiant from the shell,\\nThat brightness dazzling the sight\\nOf siblings: Leda’s eyes, as well.\\nThis land now turns to you alone,\\nOffering you its noblest flower:\\nOh, though the whole world is your own,\\nLet your country hold you in its power!\\nAnd though you may endure the sun’s cold arrow\\nUp there, on the mountain’s jagged height,\\nSee, how the rocky hillside’s green below, now,\\nWhere the goat may crop its meagre right.\\nThe sources leap, all streams rush down as one,\\nGorge, slope, and meadow are already green.\\nOn a hundred hills, rock-folded, steep and broken,\\nThe scattered woolly flocks are clearly seen.\\nSpread all around, with cautious measured stride,\\nThe horned cattle tread the dizzy edge:\\nBut here there’s shelter that the caves provide,\\nHundreds to hide them all, on the rocky ledge.\\nPan guards them too: and lively nymphs live there,\\nIn the damp fresh space of bushy clefts,\\nAnd, yearning upward to the higher air,\\nThe crowded tree its slender branches lifts.\\nPrimeval woods! The mighty oaks their cap:\\nWhose stubborn boughs stick out from them, in state:\\nWhile kindly maples, pregnant with sweet sap,\\nSoar cleanly upward, toying with the weight.\\nPure mother’s milk, in that still realm of shadows,\\nFlows rich, in readiness for lamb and child:\\nFruit’s not lacking, gift of fertile meadows,\\nAnd from the hollow trunk drips honey mild.\\nHere well-being’s granted all the race,\\nCheek and lips both to joy consent,\\nEach one is immortal, in their place:\\nAnd all there are healthy and content.\\nAnd thus the lovely child, of purest days,\\nGrows, and achieves his father’s strength.\\nWe’re amazed, the question’s still, always:\\nAre these gods, or are they truly men?\\nWhen Apollo took a shepherd’s form,\\nThe fairest of them was like the sun:\\nSince, where pure Nature is the norm,\\nThen all the worlds must move as one.\\n(Taking his seat beside her.)\\n\\nSo, this have you, and this have I achieved:\\nLet the past fade behind us: it is gone!\\nOh, know yourself from highest gods conceived,\\nTo the first world, alone then, you belong.\\nNo solid fortresses shall ring you round!\\nIn eternal youth, stands as it stood –\\nSo our stay with all delight be crowned –\\nArcadia in Sparta’s neighbourhood.\\nLured here to tread this blessed ground,\\nYou fled towards a happy destiny!\\nLet our thrones as arbours now be found,\\nOur joy be Arcadian, and free!\\n(The scene is completely transformed. Bowers are built against a range of rocky caverns. A shadowy grove runs to the foot of the rocks that rise on all sides. Faust and Helen are not visible: the Chorus lie scattered about in sleep.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nI’m not sure how long these women have been sleeping:\\nNor do I know whether they allowed themselves\\nTo dream what I saw clearly with my own eyes.\\nTherefore I’ll wake them. The young will be amazed,\\nYou bearded ones, too, who sit waiting there, below,\\nTo understand the meaning of these wonders.\\nWake! Wake, and shake the dew from your hair,\\nThe slumber from your eyes! Don’t blink so, but hear me!\\n\\nChorus says:\\nTell us, quickly, quickly, all the wonders that have happened!\\nIf we can’t believe them, we’ll enjoy them with more pleasure.\\nFor we’re wholly weary sitting, staring at these empty stones.\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nYou’ve hardly rubbed your eyes, yet you’re already weary, children?\\nWell, listen: in these caverns, in these grottos, in these arbours,\\nShade and shelter have been granted, to the two idyllic lovers,\\nOur Master and our Mistress.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nWhat, within there?\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nSweetly sundered,\\nFrom the world, alone they summoned me to grant them quiet service.\\nAt their side I stood there, honoured, yet still, as one who’s trusted,\\nAlways gazed at something other, turning here and there at random.\\nLooked for roots and bark and mosses, being skilled in all the potions,\\nAnd so they were left alone.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nYou speak as if a whole world’s space were hidden there inside, now,\\nWoods and fields and lakes and rivers: what a fantasy you spin!\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nIt’s true: you’re inexperienced, and its depths are unexplored!\\nI felt, lost in contemplation, hall on hall there, court on court.\\nIn an instant laughter echoes, through the cavernous recesses:\\nThere I see a boy is springing, from his mother to his father,\\nFrom his father to his mother, all is dandling and caressing,\\nAnd a foolish, a fond teasing, shouts of play, and cries of joy,\\nAlternate, there, and I’m deaf.\\nA naked wingless Spirit, like a faun, and yet no creature,\\nLeaps across the solid floor, and the ground beneath responding,\\nSends him flying through the ether, till the second leap or so, there,\\nHe can touch the cavern roof.\\nAnxiously his mother’s calling: ‘Leap as often as you like, dear,\\nBut all flying is forbidden, so beware of taking flight.’\\nAnd his loyal father warns him: ‘In the earth’s the power of swiftness,\\nThat will quickly send you flying: touch the ground then with your toe,\\nAnd like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’\\nSo he leaps the rocky masses of the cavern, from a cornice,\\nTo another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown.\\nBut suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern,\\nAnd it seems he’s lost. His mother grieves for him, father comforts,\\nI stand there, wondering anxiously, but there again’s the vision!\\nDo buried treasures lie there? Robes embroidered all with flowers,\\nHe has fittingly assumed.\\nTassels tremble from his shoulders, ribbons flutter round his chest,\\nIn his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo,\\nHe steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing.\\nAnd the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts,\\nWhat’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming,\\nIs it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power?\\nSo he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already\\nThe future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal\\nMelodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him,\\nAnd you too will also see him, with the rarest show of wonder.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nDo you call this a marvel,\\nCrete has begotten?\\nCan you never have listened\\nTo what Poetry teaches?\\nHave you never once heard Ionia’s,\\nHave you never listened to Hellas’\\nMost ancient of legends\\nOf the gods and heroes?\\nAll things that happen\\nIn this present age,\\nAre mournful echoes\\nOf our ancestors’ nobler times:\\nAnd your story can’t equal\\nThat, loveliest of lies,\\nEasier to believe than Truth,\\nThat they sang of Maia’s son.\\nThat delicate and strong, yet\\nScarcely born, suckling child,\\nWould you swaddle him in purest down,\\nClothe him in costly jewelled bindings,\\nThe crowd of chattering nurses’\\nUtterly senseless notion.\\nBut strong and yet delicate,\\nAlready the supple rascal,\\nDraws forth his lithe body,\\nLeaves behind that royal,\\nBut timid, constraining shell,\\nSilent, there, in its place:\\nLike the finished butterfly,\\nFrom the chilly chrysalis,\\nSlipping, with quick unfolding wings,\\nBoldly into the sunlit air,\\nAnd courageously fluttering.\\nSo did he, the liveliest,\\nAnd he quickly demonstrated\\nBy the most skilful arts,\\nThat he’d always be the patron\\nDaemon of thieves and jesters\\nAnd all seekers of profit.\\nFrom the Sea God he quickly stole\\nHis trident, and from Ares himself,\\nSlyly, his sword from its scabbard:\\nBow and arrows from Phoebus too,\\nAnd tongs from Hephaestus:\\nHe even stole Father Zeus’\\nLightning bolts, not scared of fire:\\nThen he tripped poor Eros up,\\nIn the toils of a wrestling match:\\nAs Venus kissed him, too, stole away,\\nThe ribbons from her breasts.\\n(A pure melodious and exquisite music echoes from the cave. All listen and appear deeply moved. There is a full musical accompaniment from this point to the designated pause.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nHear the loveliest of music,\\nFree from old mythology!\\nAll your gods and all their antics,\\nLet them go, they’re history.\\nNone can understand you more,\\nWe demand a higher art:\\nFrom the heart itself must pour,\\nWhat will influence the heart.\\n(She retires towards the rocks.)\\n\\nBe you stirred, you awesome being,\\nBy the sweet and flattering sound,\\nWe, renewed to life, are feeling,\\nMoved to tears of joy, around.\\nLet the sun be lost from heaven\\nSo it’s daylight in the soul,\\nWe’ll discover in the heart, then,\\nWhat the Earth fails to hold.\\n(Helen.

Gently!\\nNot into danger,\\nLest a chance downfall,\\nAwaits the ranger,\\nStraight away grounds you,\\nOur darling son!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nI can’t stick fast to\\nThe ground any more:\\nLet go my hands and\\nLet go my hair,\\nLet go my clothes!\\nThey are all mine.\\n\\nHelen says:\\nO think!

Calm excess,\\nTo please your parents,\\nToo great a liveliness,\\nImpulsive violence!\\nIn rural peacefulness,\\nBrighten the plain.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nIf that’s what you wish, yes,\\nI’ll stop, I’ll restrain.\\n(He winds, dancing, through the chorus and draws them along with him.)\\n\\nI’ll hover here, lightly\\nLively the crew.\\nIs this the melody,\\nAnd measure too?\\n\\nHelen says:\\nYes that is neatly done:\\nLead all the fairest on,\\nThrough intricacy.\\n\\nFaust says:\\nWould it were over then!\\nSuch entertainment\\nWon’t delight me.\\n\\nChorus says:\\n(\\nWith Euphorion, dancing nimbly and singing, in interlinking ranks.)\\nWhen your arms equally\\nAre charmingly lifted,\\nYour curling hair’s brightly\\nLoosened and shifted.\\nWhen with a foot so light\\nOver the earth in flight,\\nThither and back again,\\nStep upon step, you rain,\\nThen your goal is in sight,\\nLoveliest child:\\nAll of our hearts, beguiled,\\nWith yours unite.\\n(Pause.)\\n\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nYou’re like so many\\nLight-footed fawns:\\nNow to new games we\\nAre quickly re-born!\\nI’ll be the hunter,\\nYou be the prey.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nIf you would catch us\\nDon’t be so eager,\\nWe too are anxious\\nWhen all is over,\\nTo clasp the form,\\nYou so sweetly display!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nNow through the vale!\\nUp hill and down dale!\\nWhat I gain easily\\nIs tedious to see,\\nOnly what’s forcibly\\nWon delights me.\\n\\nHelen and Faust says:\\nHow wild he is now! And how stubborn!\\nThere’s little hope of moderation.\\nThat’s the sound of blowing horns,\\nThrough the woods and valley ringing:\\nWhat noise, and what confusion!\\n\\nChorus says:\\n(\\nEntering one by one, in haste.)\\nHe is running from us swiftly:\\nScorning us and always mocking,\\nNow he drags one from the crowd: she,\\nThe wildest of us all.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\n(\\nDragging along a young girl.)\\nHere I’ll drag the little quarry,\\nTo enforce my wish entirely:\\nFor my joy, and my desire,\\nPress her wilful heart, on fire,\\nKiss her stubborn mouth at length\\nAnd proclaim my will and strength.\\n\\nThe Girl says:\\nLet me go! Since there’s a strong\\nResistant spirit in this body:\\nMy will, like yours, if I’m not wrong,\\nSays I’m not taken easily.\\nYou think I’m in any danger?\\nForce of arms is it, you claim!\\nHold me fast, you foolish ranger,\\nAnd I’ll scotch your little game.\\n(She turns to flame and flashes into the air.)\\n\\nFollow me through flowing air,\\nFollow me through caverns bare,\\nCatch your fleeing prey again!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\n(\\nShaking off the flames.)\\nRocks all around me here,\\nDeep in the forest view,\\nMake me a prisoner,\\nThough I’m still young and new.\\nBreezes are blowing fair,\\nWaves now are breaking there:\\nI hear both far away,\\nI’d gladly be there today.\\n(He leaps further up the rocks.)\\n\\n\\nHelen, Faust and the Chorus says:\\nA chamois you’d imitate?\\nWe’re fearful of your fate.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nEver higher I must climb.\\nEver further I must see.\\nNow I know where I stand!\\nAmidst this semi-island,\\nAmidst Pelop’s country,\\nEarth – kindred to the sea.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nWhy not live here, in peace,\\nAmong hills and groves?\\nVines then for you we’ll seek,\\nVines in their rows.\\nVines on high ridges stand,\\nFigs, there, and apples gold,\\nStay in this lovely land\\nStay, and grow old!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nDo you dream of peaceful days?\\nDream, then as dreamers may.\\nWar is the watchword though.\\nVictory!

What disaster!\\nIs then death ordained for you?\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nShould I watch it from afar?\\nNo! I’ll share their trouble too.\\n\\nHelen, Faust and the Chorus says:\\nExuberance, danger,\\nDeadliest fate!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nYes! – I am winged here,\\nI will not wait!\\nOnward! I must! I must!\\nLet me but fly!\\n(He hurls himself into the air: his clothes bear him a moment, his head is illuminated and a streak of light follows.)\\n\\n\\nChorus says:\\nIcarus! Icarus!\\nNo more! We sigh.\\n(A beautiful youth falls at the parents’ feet. We imagine we see a well-known form in the dead body, but the physical part vanishes at once, while an aureole rises like a comet to heaven.

Though from the day you part,\\nNot one heart will part from you.\\nWe scarcely wish to mourn you, even,\\nWe sing in envy of your fate:\\nTo you the clearest light of heaven,\\nGave song and courage, true and great.\\nAh! You were born for earthly fate,\\nHigh descent and supreme power:\\nYouth, sadly, while you went astray,\\nWas torn from you in its first hour!\\nYou saw the world, with clearer vision,\\nYou understood the yearning heart,\\nThe glow of lovely woman’s passion,\\nAnd all singing’s rarest art.\\nYet, irresistibly, you ran free,\\nIn nets of indiscipline: you\\nDivorced yourself violently,\\nFrom custom, and from rule:\\nUntil at last, through thinking deeper,\\nYou gave courage greater weight,\\nAnd wished to win to splendour,\\nBut that could not be your fate.\\nWhose then? – The gloomy question,\\nThat destiny itself conceals,\\nWhile in days unblessed by fortune,\\nOur people’s silent blood congeals.\\nBut new songs will refresh them,\\nNo longer bow them to the floor,\\nThe earth shall see them once again,\\nAs it saw them once before.\\n(A complete Pause. The music ends.)\\n\\n\\nHelen says:\\n(\\nTo Faust.)\\nAlas, the ancient word proves true for me, as well:\\nThat joy and beauty never lastingly unite.\\nThe thread of life, as the thread of love, is torn:\\nPainfully, lamenting both, I must say: farewell,\\nAnd enter your embrace, once, and then no more.\\nPersephone, receive me, and this child of ours!\\n(She embraces Faust: her body vanishes, her dress and veil remain in his hands.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\n(\\nTo Faust.)\\nHold tight to what alone remains to you.\\nDon’t let the garment go. Already, daemons\\nPull at its hem, and wish to drag it down\\nInto the Underworld. Hold tight to it, now!\\nIt no longer veils the divinity you’ve lost,\\nBut it is divine. Employ then the priceless,\\nNoble gift for yourself, and soar on high:\\nIt will carry you quickly from the lowest\\nTo the highest ether, while you can endure.\\nWe’ll meet once more, far away from here.\\n(Helen’s garments dissolve in mist, surround Faust, life him into the air, and drift away with him.)\\n\\n(Phorkyas takes Euphorion’s tunic, cloak and lyre from the ground, steps forward to the proscenium, holds them aloft and speaks.)\\n\\nAs always, I’ve discovered something good!\\nThe flame itself has gone, that’s understood,\\nYet, for the world, I can’t be truly sad.\\nHere’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment,\\nStir their guild to envy, make them mad,\\nAnd if I still can’t lend them any talent,\\nAt least I’ll have a costume for the lad.\\n(She seats herself on a low column in the proscenium.)\\n\\n\\nPanthalis says:\\nQuick now, girls! We’re all free of the magic now,\\nThat old Thessalian woman’s enthralling spell,\\nThat jangling dizziness of confusing sound,\\nTroubling the ear, and more the inner sense.\\nDown to Hades!

One’s always certain,\\nFiercely, to contradict the others, others her:\\nOnly, they laugh or cry alike, in joy or pain.\\nNow, hush! And listen to what our high-minded\\nMistress may decide, here, for herself and us.\\n\\nHelen says:\\nPythoness, where are you? However you’re named:\\nCome out from the arches of this dark fortress.\\nIf you come from the wondrous lord and hero\\nTo announce me, and ready a fit reception,\\nAccept my thanks, and lead me there quickly:\\nI wish my wanderings ended. I want to rest.\\n\\nThe Leader of the Chorus says:\\nQueen, in vain, you look about in all directions:\\nThat wretched shape has vanished, stayed perhaps\\nThere in the vapour, out of whose depths we came,\\nI cannot tell how, so swiftly, without a footfall.\\nPerhaps she wanders lost in the vast labyrinth\\nOf these many castles wondrously merged in one.\\nSeeking high and princely greeting from her lord.\\nBut see! There a crowd moves about in readiness.\\nAlong galleries, at windows, through the doors\\nCome a crowd of servants, scurrying to and fro:\\nIt proclaims a noblest welcome for the guest.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nMy heart is eased! O, see over there,\\nHow a company of handsome youths approach\\nWith lingering step, in dignified order,\\nMarching in ranks. Who gave out the command\\nTo marshal them, and so quickly arranged\\nAll this youthful team of so handsome a race?\\nWhat shall I admire most? Is it the graceful step,\\nOr the curls of hair on the palest of brows,\\nOr the rounded cheeks with a peach’s blushes,\\nAnd like it also, in their silkiest down?\\nI’d gladly bite, yet I’m frightened to try it:\\nSince in a similar case, and I shudder to say it,\\nThe mouth was as suddenly filled, with ashes!\\nBut the handsomest\\nCome to us now:\\nWhat do they carry?\\nSteps for the throne,\\nCarpets and seat,\\nCurtain, canopy,\\nJewelled finery:\\nWaving above us,\\nForming a garland,\\nOver the head of our Queen:\\nFor she, already, invited\\nAscends, to the noble seat.\\nForward now,\\nStep by step,\\nSolemnly ranked.\\nWorthy, O worthy, triply worthy,\\nLet such a reception be blessed!\\n(What the Chorus has described takes place. After the boys and squires have descended in long procession, Faust appears above, at the top of the staircase, in the costume of a knight of the Middle Ages, and then descends slowly and with dignity.)\\n\\n\\nThe Leader of the Chorus says:\\n(\\nObserving him closely.)\\nIf indeed the gods have not, as they often do,\\nOnly lent this man brave form, for an instant,\\nExalted his dignity, and charming presence,\\nAs a temporary act, then whatever he does\\nHe’ll succeed, whether it’s warring with men,\\nOr in the lesser struggles with lovely ladies.\\nTruly I prefer him to hosts of others,\\nWhom my eyes have seen, the highly praised.\\nI see the Prince approach, with slow solemn step,\\nRestrained by reverence: Queen, turn towards him!\\n\\nFaust says:\\n(\\nApproaching: a man in chains at his side.)\\nInstead of the usual calm greeting\\nInstead of a reverential welcome,\\nHere I bring a wretch bound fast with chains,\\nWho failed so in his duty, I failed mine.\\nKneel here, so this noble lady\\nMay hear a prompt confession of your guilt.\\n\\nBecause of his keen vision to gaze about\\nFrom the high tower, and to look keenly\\nAt heaven’s spaces, and the breadth of earth,\\nTo report whatever moves here or there,\\nFrom the encircling hills, to the castle,\\nWhether a transit of the woolly flocks,\\nOr soldiers: so we can protect the first,\\nAttack the others. Today, negligence!\\nYou came here: he had nothing to report:\\nWe failed in the reception you deserved,\\nIn honour of the guest. Now he forfeits\\nHis guilty life, and would have shed his blood\\nIn a merited death: but only you alone\\nShall pardon him or punish, as you wish.\\n\\nHelen says:\\nSuch great power you choose to grant me,\\nAs judge, as Mistress too, though, I suspect\\nYou intend it as a kind of test –\\nYet, I’ll employ a judge’s first duty,\\nTo give the accused a hearing. Speak out.\\n\\nLynceus, the Warden of the Tower says:\\nLet me kneel, and let me see her,\\nLet me live, or let me die,\\nAlready I’m devoted to her\\nHeavenly lady from on high.\\nWaiting for the dawn’s advances,\\nGazing at her eastern house,\\nSuddenly the sunlight dances,\\nMarvellously in the south!\\nDrawn to see the marvel closer,\\nInstead of the ravine and height,\\nInstead of earth and heaven there,\\nI gazed at her, the sole delight.\\nI was granted powers of vision\\nLike the lynx, high in the tree:\\nBut now I peered in indecision\\nAs in a dark and clouded dream.\\nHow think? Even if I’d so wished?\\nWall, and tower? Bolted gate?\\nMist, it rose, and cleared the mist,\\nCame the Goddess here in state!\\nI surrendered heart and eye\\nDrinking in the gentle light:\\nHow that beauty blinds, and I\\nWas blinded wholly by the sight.\\nI forgot the watchman’s duty,\\nAnd the promised trumpet call:\\nThreaten then, now, to destroy me –\\nAnger lies in Beauty’s thrall.\\n\\nHelen says:\\nI cannot punish this evil that I brought here,\\nWith me.

The mighty oaks their cap:\\nWhose stubborn boughs stick out from them, in state:\\nWhile kindly maples, pregnant with sweet sap,\\nSoar cleanly upward, toying with the weight.\\nPure mother’s milk, in that still realm of shadows,\\nFlows rich, in readiness for lamb and child:\\nFruit’s not lacking, gift of fertile meadows,\\nAnd from the hollow trunk drips honey mild.\\nHere well-being’s granted all the race,\\nCheek and lips both to joy consent,\\nEach one is immortal, in their place:\\nAnd all there are healthy and content.\\nAnd thus the lovely child, of purest days,\\nGrows, and achieves his father’s strength.\\nWe’re amazed, the question’s still, always:\\nAre these gods, or are they truly men?\\nWhen Apollo took a shepherd’s form,\\nThe fairest of them was like the sun:\\nSince, where pure Nature is the norm,\\nThen all the worlds must move as one.\\n(Taking his seat beside her.)\\n\\nSo, this have you, and this have I achieved:\\nLet the past fade behind us: it is gone!\\nOh, know yourself from highest gods conceived,\\nTo the first world, alone then, you belong.\\nNo solid fortresses shall ring you round!\\nIn eternal youth, stands as it stood –\\nSo our stay with all delight be crowned –\\nArcadia in Sparta’s neighbourhood.\\nLured here to tread this blessed ground,\\nYou fled towards a happy destiny!\\nLet our thrones as arbours now be found,\\nOur joy be Arcadian, and free!\\n(The scene is completely transformed. Bowers are built against a range of rocky caverns. A shadowy grove runs to the foot of the rocks that rise on all sides. Faust and Helen are not visible: the Chorus lie scattered about in sleep.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nI’m not sure how long these women have been sleeping:\\nNor do I know whether they allowed themselves\\nTo dream what I saw clearly with my own eyes.\\nTherefore I’ll wake them. The young will be amazed,\\nYou bearded ones, too, who sit waiting there, below,\\nTo understand the meaning of these wonders.\\nWake! Wake, and shake the dew from your hair,\\nThe slumber from your eyes! Don’t blink so, but hear me!\\n\\nChorus says:\\nTell us, quickly, quickly, all the wonders that have happened!\\nIf we can’t believe them, we’ll enjoy them with more pleasure.\\nFor we’re wholly weary sitting, staring at these empty stones.\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nYou’ve hardly rubbed your eyes, yet you’re already weary, children?\\nWell, listen: in these caverns, in these grottos, in these arbours,\\nShade and shelter have been granted, to the two idyllic lovers,\\nOur Master and our Mistress.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nWhat, within there?\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nSweetly sundered,\\nFrom the world, alone they summoned me to grant them quiet service.\\nAt their side I stood there, honoured, yet still, as one who’s trusted,\\nAlways gazed at something other, turning here and there at random.\\nLooked for roots and bark and mosses, being skilled in all the potions,\\nAnd so they were left alone.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nYou speak as if a whole world’s space were hidden there inside, now,\\nWoods and fields and lakes and rivers: what a fantasy you spin!\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nIt’s true: you’re inexperienced, and its depths are unexplored!\\nI felt, lost in contemplation, hall on hall there, court on court.\\nIn an instant laughter echoes, through the cavernous recesses:\\nThere I see a boy is springing, from his mother to his father,\\nFrom his father to his mother, all is dandling and caressing,\\nAnd a foolish, a fond teasing, shouts of play, and cries of joy,\\nAlternate, there, and I’m deaf.\\nA naked wingless Spirit, like a faun, and yet no creature,\\nLeaps across the solid floor, and the ground beneath responding,\\nSends him flying through the ether, till the second leap or so, there,\\nHe can touch the cavern roof.\\nAnxiously his mother’s calling: ‘Leap as often as you like, dear,\\nBut all flying is forbidden, so beware of taking flight.’\\nAnd his loyal father warns him: ‘In the earth’s the power of swiftness,\\nThat will quickly send you flying: touch the ground then with your toe,\\nAnd like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’\\nSo he leaps the rocky masses of the cavern, from a cornice,\\nTo another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown.\\nBut suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern,\\nAnd it seems he’s lost. His mother grieves for him, father comforts,\\nI stand there, wondering anxiously, but there again’s the vision!\\nDo buried treasures lie there? Robes embroidered all with flowers,\\nHe has fittingly assumed.\\nTassels tremble from his shoulders, ribbons flutter round his chest,\\nIn his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo,\\nHe steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing.\\nAnd the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts,\\nWhat’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming,\\nIs it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power?\\nSo he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already\\nThe future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal\\nMelodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him,\\nAnd you too will also see him, with the rarest show of wonder.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nDo you call this a marvel,\\nCrete has begotten?\\nCan you never have listened\\nTo what Poetry teaches?\\nHave you never once heard Ionia’s,\\nHave you never listened to Hellas’\\nMost ancient of legends\\nOf the gods and heroes?\\nAll things that happen\\nIn this present age,\\nAre mournful echoes\\nOf our ancestors’ nobler times:\\nAnd your story can’t equal\\nThat, loveliest of lies,\\nEasier to believe than Truth,\\nThat they sang of Maia’s son.\\nThat delicate and strong, yet\\nScarcely born, suckling child,\\nWould you swaddle him in purest down,\\nClothe him in costly jewelled bindings,\\nThe crowd of chattering nurses’\\nUtterly senseless notion.\\nBut strong and yet delicate,\\nAlready the supple rascal,\\nDraws forth his lithe body,\\nLeaves behind that royal,\\nBut timid, constraining shell,\\nSilent, there, in its place:\\nLike the finished butterfly,\\nFrom the chilly chrysalis,\\nSlipping, with quick unfolding wings,\\nBoldly into the sunlit air,\\nAnd courageously fluttering.\\nSo did he, the liveliest,\\nAnd he quickly demonstrated\\nBy the most skilful arts,\\nThat he’d always be the patron\\nDaemon of thieves and jesters\\nAnd all seekers of profit.\\nFrom the Sea God he quickly stole\\nHis trident, and from Ares himself,\\nSlyly, his sword from its scabbard:\\nBow and arrows from Phoebus too,\\nAnd tongs from Hephaestus:\\nHe even stole Father Zeus’\\nLightning bolts, not scared of fire:\\nThen he tripped poor Eros up,\\nIn the toils of a wrestling match:\\nAs Venus kissed him, too, stole away,\\nThe ribbons from her breasts.\\n(A pure melodious and exquisite music echoes from the cave. All listen and appear deeply moved. There is a full musical accompaniment from this point to the designated pause.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\nHear the loveliest of music,\\nFree from old mythology!\\nAll your gods and all their antics,\\nLet them go, they’re history.\\nNone can understand you more,\\nWe demand a higher art:\\nFrom the heart itself must pour,\\nWhat will influence the heart.\\n(She retires towards the rocks.)\\n\\nBe you stirred, you awesome being,\\nBy the sweet and flattering sound,\\nWe, renewed to life, are feeling,\\nMoved to tears of joy, around.\\nLet the sun be lost from heaven\\nSo it’s daylight in the soul,\\nWe’ll discover in the heart, then,\\nWhat the Earth fails to hold.\\n(Helen. Faust.

Gently!\\nNot into danger,\\nLest a chance downfall,\\nAwaits the ranger,\\nStraight away grounds you,\\nOur darling son!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nI can’t stick fast to\\nThe ground any more:\\nLet go my hands and\\nLet go my hair,\\nLet go my clothes!\\nThey are all mine.\\n\\nHelen says:\\nO think! Please think,\\nWhom you belong to!\\nHow it would grieve us,\\nHow you’d destroy too,\\nThat sweet achievement,\\nYours, his and mine.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nI fear this unity\\nSoon will unwind!\\n\\nHelen and Faust says:\\nCalm yourself! Calm excess,\\nTo please your parents,\\nToo great a liveliness,\\nImpulsive violence!\\nIn rural peacefulness,\\nBrighten the plain.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nIf that’s what you wish, yes,\\nI’ll stop, I’ll restrain.\\n(He winds, dancing, through the chorus and draws them along with him.)\\n\\nI’ll hover here, lightly\\nLively the crew.\\nIs this the melody,\\nAnd measure too?\\n\\nHelen says:\\nYes that is neatly done:\\nLead all the fairest on,\\nThrough intricacy.\\n\\nFaust says:\\nWould it were over then!\\nSuch entertainment\\nWon’t delight me.\\n\\nChorus says:\\n(\\nWith Euphorion, dancing nimbly and singing, in interlinking ranks.)\\nWhen your arms equally\\nAre charmingly lifted,\\nYour curling hair’s brightly\\nLoosened and shifted.\\nWhen with a foot so light\\nOver the earth in flight,\\nThither and back again,\\nStep upon step, you rain,\\nThen your goal is in sight,\\nLoveliest child:\\nAll of our hearts, beguiled,\\nWith yours unite.\\n(Pause.)\\n\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nYou’re like so many\\nLight-footed fawns:\\nNow to new games we\\nAre quickly re-born!\\nI’ll be the hunter,\\nYou be the prey.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nIf you would catch us\\nDon’t be so eager,\\nWe too are anxious\\nWhen all is over,\\nTo clasp the form,\\nYou so sweetly display!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nNow through the vale!\\nUp hill and down dale!\\nWhat I gain easily\\nIs tedious to see,\\nOnly what’s forcibly\\nWon delights me.\\n\\nHelen and Faust says:\\nHow wild he is now! And how stubborn!\\nThere’s little hope of moderation.\\nThat’s the sound of blowing horns,\\nThrough the woods and valley ringing:\\nWhat noise, and what confusion!\\n\\nChorus says:\\n(\\nEntering one by one, in haste.)\\nHe is running from us swiftly:\\nScorning us and always mocking,\\nNow he drags one from the crowd: she,\\nThe wildest of us all.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\n(\\nDragging along a young girl.)\\nHere I’ll drag the little quarry,\\nTo enforce my wish entirely:\\nFor my joy, and my desire,\\nPress her wilful heart, on fire,\\nKiss her stubborn mouth at length\\nAnd proclaim my will and strength.\\n\\nThe Girl says:\\nLet me go! Since there’s a strong\\nResistant spirit in this body:\\nMy will, like yours, if I’m not wrong,\\nSays I’m not taken easily.\\nYou think I’m in any danger?\\nForce of arms is it, you claim!\\nHold me fast, you foolish ranger,\\nAnd I’ll scotch your little game.\\n(She turns to flame and flashes into the air.)\\n\\nFollow me through flowing air,\\nFollow me through caverns bare,\\nCatch your fleeing prey again!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\n(\\nShaking off the flames.)\\nRocks all around me here,\\nDeep in the forest view,\\nMake me a prisoner,\\nThough I’m still young and new.\\nBreezes are blowing fair,\\nWaves now are breaking there:\\nI hear both far away,\\nI’d gladly be there today.\\n(He leaps further up the rocks.)\\n\\n\\nHelen, Faust and the Chorus says:\\nA chamois you’d imitate?\\nWe’re fearful of your fate.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nEver higher I must climb.\\nEver further I must see.\\nNow I know where I stand!\\nAmidst this semi-island,\\nAmidst Pelop’s country,\\nEarth – kindred to the sea.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nWhy not live here, in peace,\\nAmong hills and groves?\\nVines then for you we’ll seek,\\nVines in their rows.\\nVines on high ridges stand,\\nFigs, there, and apples gold,\\nStay in this lovely land\\nStay, and grow old!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nDo you dream of peaceful days?\\nDream, then as dreamers may.\\nWar is the watchword though.\\nVictory! It rings out so.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nHe who in time of peace\\nWishes for war, soon\\nWitness’s the decease,\\nOf hope, and fortune.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nThose who made this land,\\nWith danger on every hand,\\nFree, and courageously,\\nGave their blood lavishly:\\nBring holy meaning\\nTo that sacrifice –\\nSee us still conquering\\nAll whom we fight!\\n\\nChorus says:\\nLook up there, how high he climbs!\\nYet he seems to us no smaller:\\nIn his armour, as in triumph,\\nHow he gleams in steel and silver.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nEach one’s no longer conscious\\nOf the high wall, or the rest:\\nSince the one enduring fortress,\\nIs the soldier’s iron breast.\\nIf you’d live unconquered,\\nQuickly arm, and fight the real foe:\\nEvery wife an Amazon bred,\\nAnd every child a hero.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nSacred Poetry\\nClimbing, and heavenly!\\nShines there, the fairest star,\\nFar there, and still so far!\\nAnd yet it reaches here,\\nAlways, and still we hear,\\nJoy, where we are.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nNo, not as a child do I appear,\\nThis youth comes armed, you see:\\nIn spirit he’s already a peer,\\nOf the strong, the bold, and free.\\nNow I go!\\nNow, and lo,\\nThe path to glory shines for me.\\n\\nHelen and Faust says:\\nYou’ve scarcely been called to being,\\nScarcely come to daylight’s gleam,\\nAnd from the heights you’re yearning,\\nFor the place of pain, it seems.\\nAre we two\\nNaught to you?\\nIs the sweetest bond a dream?\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nDon’t you hear the thundering wave?\\nThrough vale on vale the echoes call,\\nHost on host, in sand and spray,\\nShock on shock, in anguished fall.\\nUnderstand\\nThe command\\nIs death, now and for all.\\n\\nHelen, Faust and the Chorus says:\\nWhat horror! What disaster!\\nIs then death ordained for you?\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nShould I watch it from afar?\\nNo! I’ll share their trouble too.\\n\\nHelen, Faust and the Chorus says:\\nExuberance, danger,\\nDeadliest fate!\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\nYes! – I am winged here,\\nI will not wait!\\nOnward! I must! I must!\\nLet me but fly!\\n(He hurls himself into the air: his clothes bear him a moment, his head is illuminated and a streak of light follows.)\\n\\n\\nChorus says:\\nIcarus! Icarus!\\nNo more! We sigh.\\n(A beautiful youth falls at the parents’ feet. We imagine we see a well-known form in the dead body, but the physical part vanishes at once, while an aureole rises like a comet to heaven. The clothes, cloak and lyre remain on the ground.)\\n\\n\\nHelen and Faust says:\\nAt once, joy is followed,\\nBy bitterest pain.\\n\\nEuphorion says:\\n(\\nFrom the depths.)\\nMother, don’t leave me alone,\\nIn the shadows’ domain!\\n(Pause)\\n\\n\\nChorus says:\\n(\\nDirge.)\\nNot alone! – No matter where you are,\\nFor we believe in following you:\\nOh! Though from the day you part,\\nNot one heart will part from you.\\nWe scarcely wish to mourn you, even,\\nWe sing in envy of your fate:\\nTo you the clearest light of heaven,\\nGave song and courage, true and great.\\nAh! You were born for earthly fate,\\nHigh descent and supreme power:\\nYouth, sadly, while you went astray,\\nWas torn from you in its first hour!\\nYou saw the world, with clearer vision,\\nYou understood the yearning heart,\\nThe glow of lovely woman’s passion,\\nAnd all singing’s rarest art.\\nYet, irresistibly, you ran free,\\nIn nets of indiscipline: you\\nDivorced yourself violently,\\nFrom custom, and from rule:\\nUntil at last, through thinking deeper,\\nYou gave courage greater weight,\\nAnd wished to win to splendour,\\nBut that could not be your fate.\\nWhose then? – The gloomy question,\\nThat destiny itself conceals,\\nWhile in days unblessed by fortune,\\nOur people’s silent blood congeals.\\nBut new songs will refresh them,\\nNo longer bow them to the floor,\\nThe earth shall see them once again,\\nAs it saw them once before.\\n(A complete Pause. The music ends.)\\n\\n\\nHelen says:\\n(\\nTo Faust.)\\nAlas, the ancient word proves true for me, as well:\\nThat joy and beauty never lastingly unite.\\nThe thread of life, as the thread of love, is torn:\\nPainfully, lamenting both, I must say: farewell,\\nAnd enter your embrace, once, and then no more.\\nPersephone, receive me, and this child of ours!\\n(She embraces Faust: her body vanishes, her dress and veil remain in his hands.)\\n\\n\\nPhorkyas says:\\n(\\nTo Faust.)\\nHold tight to what alone remains to you.\\nDon’t let the garment go. Already, daemons\\nPull at its hem, and wish to drag it down\\nInto the Underworld. Hold tight to it, now!\\nIt no longer veils the divinity you’ve lost,\\nBut it is divine. Employ then the priceless,\\nNoble gift for yourself, and soar on high:\\nIt will carry you quickly from the lowest\\nTo the highest ether, while you can endure.\\nWe’ll meet once more, far away from here.\\n(Helen’s garments dissolve in mist, surround Faust, life him into the air, and drift away with him.)\\n\\n(Phorkyas takes Euphorion’s tunic, cloak and lyre from the ground, steps forward to the proscenium, holds them aloft and speaks.)\\n\\nAs always, I’ve discovered something good!\\nThe flame itself has gone, that’s understood,\\nYet, for the world, I can’t be truly sad.\\nHere’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment,\\nStir their guild to envy, make them mad,\\nAnd if I still can’t lend them any talent,\\nAt least I’ll have a costume for the lad.\\n(She seats herself on a low column in the proscenium.)\\n\\n\\nPanthalis says:\\nQuick now, girls! We’re all free of the magic now,\\nThat old Thessalian woman’s enthralling spell,\\nThat jangling dizziness of confusing sound,\\nTroubling the ear, and more the inner sense.\\nDown to Hades! Since with solemn step the Queen\\nDescended swiftly. Let her faithful servants’\\nFootsteps follow her downward path without delay.\\nWe’ll find her beside the Unfathomable Throne.\\n\\nChorus says:\\nOf course, queens are happy anywhere:\\nEven in Hades they’re on top,\\nAssociating proudly with their peers,\\nPersephone’s intimate company.\\nBut for us, then, in the background,\\nOf the asphodel-meadowed depths,\\nWith their long rows of poplars,\\nTheir fruitless crowds of willows,\\nWhat fun is there for us,\\nPiping like bats at twilight,\\nIn cheerless, ghostly whispers?\\n\\nPanthalis says:\\nWho wins no name, and wills no noble work,\\nBelongs to the elements: so away with you!\\nMy own intense desire’s to be with my Queen,\\nThe individual’s loyalty and not just service.\\n(Exits.)\\n\\n\\nAll says:\\nWe’re returned to the light of day,\\nNo longer individual, it’s true,\\nWe feel it, and we know it,\\nBut we’ll never go back to Hades.\\nEver-living Nature,\\nMakes the most valid claim\\nOn our spirits, and we on her.\\n\\nA Section of the Chorus says:\\nWe in all the thousand branches’ whispering tremors, swaying murmurs,\\nSweetly rocked, will lightly draw the root-born founts of being upwards,\\nTo the twigs: and now with leaves, and now with the exuberant blossom,\\nWe’ll adorn their floating tresses, freely thriving in the breezes.\\nStraight away, now, as the fruit falls, happy crowds and flocks will gather,\\nFor the picking and the tasting, swift-arriving, busy-thronging:\\nBending down, now, all around us, as before the early gods.\\n\\nA Second Section of the Chorus says:\\nWe, against the rocky cliff face, by the smooth far-gleaming mirror,\\nWe will nestle, softly moving, in the gentle waves that flatter:\\nListening, hearing every echo, birdsong, now, or reedy fluting,\\nTo the fearful voice of Pan, too, we’ll provide a ready answer:\\nTo the murmuring, send a murmur: to the thunder roll our thunder,\\nIn earth-shaking repetition, in threefold, or tenfold echo.\\n\\nA Third Section of the Chorus says:\\nSisters! We, of nimbler senses, hurry onwards with the waters:\\nFor the richly covered, far-off, mountain ranges each entice us.\\nEver deeper, ever downward, in meandering curves we’ll water\\nFirst the meadows, then the pastures, then the house and the garden,\\nWhere the slender tips of cypress, over banks and watery mirror,\\nOver all the landscape, mark it, soaring skywards in the air.\\n\\nA Fourth Section of the Chorus says:\\nWander where you please, you others: we will circle, we will rustle\\nRound the densely planted hillside, where the vine stock’s growing green:\\nThere, each day, we’ll pay attention to the cultivator’s passion,\\nWatch his diligence and care, there: watch for its uncertain outcome.\\nHow he hoes, how he digs there, how he heaps, and prunes, and ties,\\nPrays to all the gods above him, most of all prays to the sun god.\\nThe effeminate one, Bacchus, gives scant thought to faithful servants,\\nRests in arbours, lolls in caverns, flirting with the youngest Faun.\\nWhatsoever he might need there, for his half-befuddled dreaming,\\nIs left for him in wineskins, stored around in jars and vessels,\\nRight and left, in cool recesses, gathered through the endless ages.\\nBut when the gods, that’s Helios, we mean before all others,\\nCooling, wetting, warming, heating, fill the vineyard’s horn of plenty,\\nWhere the silent grower laboured, suddenly it’s all enlivened,\\nAnd in every leaf there’s rustling, rustling now from vine to vine.\\nBaskets creaking, buckets rattling, the tubs are carried groaning,\\nAll towards enormous vats there, to the lusty treaders’ dance:\\nSo, then, all the sacred bounty, of the pure bred juicy harvest,\\nFiercely trodden, spurting, foaming, mingled there, is crudely squashed.\\nNow the cymbals’ brazen clamour’s ringing boldly in our ears,\\nAs Dionysus from his Mysteries is unveiled, and is revealed:\\nHere with his goat-foot Satyrs, whirling goat-foot Satyresses,\\nAnd Silenus’s, unruly, long-eared ass, that brays amongst them.\\nNothing’s spared! The cloven feet now, trample on all decency:\\nAll the senses whirl, bewildered: hideously, ears are stunned, there.\\nDrunkards fumble for their wine-cups, head and bellies over-full,\\nHere and there one has misgivings, but can only swell the riot,\\nSince to hold the latest vintage, one must drain the oldest skin!\\n(The curtain falls. Phorkyas in the proscenium rises to full height, steps down from her tragic buskins, removes her mask and veil, and reveals herself as Mephistopheles, to point the last lines, by way of epilogue.)\\n\\n\",\"Faust says:\\nDon’t seek to analyse so rare a fate!\\nOur duty is to live: though but a day.\\n\")',),\n",

      "In Goethe's Faust, Faust's bargain with the devil is a central theme throughout the play. After making his deal with Mephistopheles on Walpurgis Night, Faust agrees to renounce his humanity and become \"enlightened\" in exchange for 24 years of immortal life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, Faust makes the following bargains:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immortal Life**: In return for not being able to die until he is 64 years old (since Faust's death occurred before this was a concern), Faust is granted eternal life.\n",
      "2. **Knowledge and Power**: Faust agrees to surrender his natural human emotions, including love, desire, and compassion, in exchange for all the knowledge and power of humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Mephistopheles' ultimate goal is not just to grant Faust immortality but also to corrupt him through his newfound power and knowledge. Faust's bargain comes with a terrible price: he loses his humanity, his sense of self, and ultimately, his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the play, Goethe explores the complexities of Faust's bargain, highlighting both its benefits and drawbacks. The devil's promise of immortality is seductive, but it also leads to Faust's downfall, as seen in Act 3, Scene 4-5, where Faust becomes increasingly disillusioned with his deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, Faust's decision to make the bargain is a tragic mistake, as he loses everything that truly mattered to him: human connection, love, and meaning."
